	abstract = {Instrumental variable analysis is an approach for obtaining causal inferences on the effect of an exposure (risk factor) on an outcome from observational data. It has gained in popularity over the past decade with the use of genetic variants as instrumental variables, known as Mendelian randomization. An instrumental variable is associated with the exposure, but not associated with any confounder of the exposure–outcome association, nor is there any causal pathway from the instrumental variable to the outcome other than via the exposure. Under the assumption that a single instrumental variable or a set of instrumental variables for the exposure is available, the causal effect of the exposure on the outcome can be estimated. There are several methods available for instrumental variable estimation; we consider the ratio method, two-stage methods, likelihood-based methods, and semi-parametric methods. Techniques for obtaining statistical inferences and confidence intervals are presented. The statistical properties of estimates from these methods are compared, and practical advice is given about choosing a suitable analysis method. In particular, bias and coverage properties of estimators are considered, especially with weak instruments. Settings particularly relevant to Mendelian randomization are prioritized in the paper, notably the scenario of a continuous exposure and a continuous or binary outcome.},

	abstract = {We propose a Bayesian approach to Mendelian randomization ({MR}), where instruments are allowed to exert pleiotropic (i.e. not mediated by the exposure) effects on the outcome. By having these effects represented in the model by unknown parameters, and by imposing a shrinkage prior distribution that assumes an unspeciﬁed subset of the effects to be zero, we obtain a proper posterior distribution for the causal effect of interest. This posterior can be sampled via Markov chain Monte Carlo methods of inference to obtain point and interval estimates. The model priors require a minimal input from the user. We explore the performance of our method by means of a simulation experiment. Our results show that the method is reasonably robust to the presence of directional pleiotropy and moderate correlation between the instruments. One section of the article elaborates the model to deal with two exposures, and illustrates the possibility of using {MR} to estimate direct and indirect effects in this situation. A main objective of the article is to create a basis for developments in {MR} that exploit the potential offered by a Bayesian approach to the problem, in relation with the possibility of incorporating external information in the prior, handling multiple sources of uncertainty, and ﬂexibly elaborating the basic model.},

We use these genomes to explore the phylogenetic history of the laboratory mouse and to examine the functional consequences of allele-specific variation on transcript abundance, revealing that at least 12\% of transcripts show a significant tissue-specific expression bias. By identifying candidate functional variants at 718 quantitative trait loci we show that the molecular nature of functional variants and their position relative to genes vary according to the effect size of the locus. These sequences provide a starting point for a new era in the functional analysis of a key model organism. Until the end of the 20th century the molecular basis for mor-phological, physiological, biochemical and behavioural variation in laboratory mice remained largely obscure 1–3 . At the beginning of the 21st century, decoding the complete genome of one strain, C57BL/6J, the mouse reference genome, revolutionized our ability to relate sequence to function 4,5 . It enabled genetic screens in mice to be per-formed on an unprecedented scale 6 , it facilitated the task of creating a complete set of null alleles for all genes 7,8 , and it accelerated the dis-covery of mouse sequence diversity 9,10 . Our catalogues, however, remain incomplete and some forms of variation are largely undocumented. Whereas we now know more about the extent of phenotypic variation among laboratory strains of mice 11–16 and the complexity of genetic action, from fully penetrant Mendelian effects, partially penetrant modifiers 17,18 and non-additive effects 18 , to the quasi-infinitesimal genetic architecture that underlies most quantitative traits 19 , we are still largely ignorant of the molecular basis of the majority of genetically influenced phenotypes.

	doi = {10.1534/genetics.115.180513},
	abstract = {Making predictions about the next 100 years of genetics research is bound to be imprecise and biased, but I am going to stick my neck out anyway and make some shorter-term predictions, some no doubt controversial, about research and likely discoveries in human complex trait genetics. I moved into the field of human complex trait genetics less than 20 years ago, from a background in quantitative ge-netics and animal breeding. Even in this period of time, major changes have occurred that were hard to predict back in the 1990s. Driven by enormous advances in {DNA} sequencing technologies, one can now sequence and analyze an entire human genome for a few thousand dollars. Some may argue that the cost of a sequenced genome is much lower than that, but that usually ignores the expense of storage, analysis, and interpretation. Sequencing technology has facilitated easy and fast discovery of Mendelian disease mutations and coding variants with high penetrance (a high probability of disease given genotype), and has led to precise estimates of the per-generation mutation rate (1000 Genomes Project Consortium et al. 2010). In the same period, development of array geno-typing technology has made it possible to genotype hundreds of thousands of {DNA} variants for less than \$100. Millions of samples have been genotyped using such arrays to study the genetic basis of complex traits such as common disease and quantitative traits, which has led to the discovery of many thousands of genes, gene variants, and biological pathways that are associated with one or more complex traits (Visscher et al. 2012). The traits vary widely, from psychiatric disorders to autoimmune disease, cancer, anthropometric traits such as height and weight, traits measured in blood such as platelet size and counts, and behavioral traits such as intelligence and years of schooling. In addition to trait-variant discovery, the technologies have led to new discoveries in human evolution and population genetics. These mostly unpredicted rapid developments were not just taking place in human complex trait genetics. In plant and animal breeding, a revolution has been taking place in the last 15 years. In 2001, a theoretical paper in this journal showed that with a sufficiently dense marker map, linkage disequi-librium could be exploited to predict breeding values and speed up genetic gain by radically changing the structure of breeding programs (Meuwissen et al. 2001). This paper was published well before the first commercial {SNP} chips were available, and within 10 years of publication, the method, called " genomic selection " (or " genomic prediction "), was implemented in dairy cattle breeding programs around the world; breeders of other livestock species and crops are following the same route. The update of this technology has led to a doubling of the rate of genetic gain in dairy cattle (Veerkamp 2015), an astounding increase and an incredibly rapid up-date of new technology. My main thesis is that the relentless pace of technological innovation will cause a change in how science is conducted. Instead of the model-based hypothesis-testing science that dom-inated the last century, the next will be hypothesis-generating-discovery science that is driven by data. I believe that this change will not be confined to human complex trait genetics, but will apply to all areas of research in genetics. Genomics will become synonymous with biology, a trend already occurring.},

In particular, the limitations of observational epidemiological study including confounding, reverse causation and measurement error can afflict conventional mediation approaches and may lead to incorrect conclusions regarding causal effects. Solutions to analysing mediation which overcome these problems include the use of instrumental variable methods such as Mendelian randomization, which may be applied to evaluate causality in increasingly complex networks of omics data.},

Formulae have been published previously for the variance of actual relationship for a number of specific types of relatives but no general formula for non-inbred individuals is available. We provide here a unified framework that enables the variances for distant relatives to be easily computed, showing, for example, how the variance of sharing for great grandparent-great grandchild, great uncle-great nephew, half uncle-nephew and first cousins differ, even though they have the same expected relationship. Results are extended in order to include differences in map length between sexes, no recombination in males and sex linkage. We derive the magnitude of skew in the proportion shared, showing the skew becomes increasingly large the more distant the relationship. The results obtained for variation in actual relationship apply directly to the variation in actual inbreeding as both are functions of genomic coancestry, and we show how to partition the variation in actual inbreeding between and within families. Although the variance of actual relationship falls as individuals become more distant, its coefficient of variation rises, and so, exacerbated by the skewness, it becomes increasingly difficult to distinguish different pedigree relationships from the actual fraction of the genome shared.},

	title = {Inference After Selecting Plausibly Valid Instruments with Application to Mendelian Randomization},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.03985},
	abstract = {Mendelian randomization ({MR}) is a popular method in genetic epidemiology to estimate the eﬀect of an exposure on an outcome by using genetic instruments. These instruments are often selected from a combination of prior knowledge from genome wide association studies ({GWAS}) and data-driven instrument selection procedures or tests. Unfortunately, when testing for the exposure eﬀect, the instrument selection process done a priori is not accounted for. This paper studies and highlights the bias resulting from not accounting for the instrument selection process by focusing on a recent data-driven instrument selection procedure, {sisVIVE}, as an example. We introduce a conditional inference approach that conditions on the instrument selection done a priori and leverage recent advances in selective inference to derive conditional null distributions of popular test statistics for the exposure eﬀect in {MR}. The null distributions can be characterized with individual-level or summary-level data in {MR}. We show that our conditional conﬁdence intervals derived from conditional null distributions attain the desired nominal level while typical conﬁdence intervals computed in {MR} do not. We conclude by reanalyzing the eﬀect of {BMI} on diastolic blood pressure using summary-level data from the {UKBiobank} that accounts for instrument selection.},

	abstract = {A transcriptome-wide association study ({TWAS}) integrates data from genome-wide association studies and gene expression mapping studies for investigating the gene regulatory mechanisms underlying diseases. Existing {TWAS} methods are primarily univariate in nature, focusing on analyzing one outcome trait at a time. However, many complex traits are correlated with each other and share a common genetic basis. Consequently, analyzing multiple traits jointly through multivariate analysis can potentially improve the power of {TWASs}. Here, we develop a method, {moPMR}-Egger (multiple outcome probabilistic Mendelian randomization with Egger assumption), for analyzing multiple outcome traits in {TWAS} applications. {moPMR}-Egger examines one gene at a time, relies on its cis-{SNPs} that are in potential linkage disequilibrium with each other to serve as instrumental variables, and tests its causal effects on multiple traits jointly. A key feature of {moPMR}-Egger is its ability to test and control for potential horizontal pleiotropic effects from instruments, thus maximizing power while minimizing false associations for {TWASs}. In simulations, {moPMR}-Egger provides calibrated type I error control for both causal effects testing and horizontal pleiotropic effects testing and is more powerful than existing univariate {TWAS} approaches in detecting causal associations. We apply {moPMR}-Egger to analyze 11 traits from 5 trait categories in the {UK} Biobank. In the analysis, {moPMR}-Egger identiﬁed 13.15\% more gene associations than univariate approaches across trait categories and revealed distinct regulatory mechanisms underlying systolic and diastolic blood pressures.},

Mediation analysis experiences a number of methodological difficulties, including bias due to confounding and measurement error. Mendelian randomisation ({MR}) can be used to improve causal inference for mediation analysis. We describe two approaches that can be used for estimating mediation analysis with {MR}: multivariable Mendelian randomisation ({MVMR}) and two-step Mendelian randomisation. We outline the approaches and provide code to demonstrate how they can be used in mediation analysis. We review issues that can affect analyses, including confounding, measurement error, weak instrument bias, and analysis of multiple mediators. Description of the methods is supplemented by simulated and real data examples. Although Mendelian randomisation relies on large sample sizes and strong assumptions, such as having strong instruments and no horizontally pleiotropic pathways, our examples demonstrate that it is unlikely to be affected by confounders of the exposure or mediator and the outcome, reverse causality and non-differential measurement error of the exposure or mediator. Both {MVMR} and two-step {MR} can be implemented in both individual-level {MR} and summary data {MR}, and can improve causal inference in mediation analysis.},

	title = {Mendelian randomization under the omnigenic architecture},
	abstract = {Mendelian randomization ({MR}) is a common analytic tool for exploring the causal relationship among complex traits. Existing {MR} methods require selecting a small set of single nucleotide polymorphisms ({SNPs}) to serve as instrument variables. However, selecting a small set of {SNPs} may not be ideal, as most complex traits have a polygenic or omnigenic architecture and are each inf luenced by thousands of {SNPs}. Here, motivated by the recent omnigenic hypothesis, we present an {MR} method that uses all genome-wide {SNPs} for causal inference. Our method uses summary statistics from genome-wide association studies as input, accommodates the commonly encountered horizontal pleiotropy effects and relies on a composite likelihood framework for scalable computation. We refer to our method as the omnigenic Mendelian randomization, or {OMR}. We examine the power and robustness of {OMR} through extensive simulations including those under various modeling misspecifications. We apply {OMR} to several real data applications, where we identify multiple complex traits that potentially causally inf luence coronary artery disease ({CAD}) and asthma. The identified new associations reveal important roles of blood lipids, blood pressure and immunity underlying {CAD} as well as important roles of immunity and obesity underlying asthma.},

Several scenarios violating the Mendelian randomization assumptions are described, including settings with inadequate phenotype definition, the setting of time-varying exposures, the presence of gene–environment interaction, the existence of measurement error, the possibility of reverse causation, and the presence of linkage disequilibrium. Data analysis examples are given, illustrating that the inappropriate use of instrumental variable techniques when the Mendelian randomization assumptions are violated can lead to biases of enormous magnitude. To help address some of the strong assumptions being made, three possible approaches are suggested. First, the original proposal of Katan (Lancet. 1986;1:507–508) for Mendelian randomization was not to use instrumental variable techniques to obtain estimates but merely to examine genotype–outcome associations to test for the presence of an effect of the exposure on the outcome. We show that this more modest goal and approach can circumvent many, though not all, the potential biases described. Second, we discuss the use of sensitivity analysis in evaluating the consequences of violations in the assumptions and in attempting to correct for those violations. Third, we suggest that a focus on negative, rather than positive, Mendelian randomization results may turn out to be more reliable.},

	abstract = {Mendelian randomization is a powerful tool for inferring the presence, or otherwise, of causal effects from observational data. However, the nature of genetic variants is such that pleiotropy remains a barrier to valid causal effect estimation. There are many options in the literature for pleiotropy robust methods when studying the effects of a single risk factor on an outcome. However, there are few pleiotropy robust methods in the multivariable setting, that is, when there are multiple risk factors of interest. In this article we introduce three methods which build on common approaches in the univariable setting: {MVMR}-Robust; {MVMR}-Median; and {MVMR}-Lasso. We discuss the properties of each of these methods and examine their performance in comparison to existing approaches in a simulation study. {MVMR}-Robust is shown to outperform existing outlier robust approaches when there are low levels of pleiotropy. {MVMR}-Lasso provides the best estimation in terms of mean squared error for moderate to high levels of pleiotropy, and can provide valid inference in a three sample setting. {MVMR}-Median performs well in terms of estimation across all scenarios considered, and provides valid inference up to a moderate level of pleiotropy. We demonstrate the methods in an applied example looking at the effects of intelligence, education and household income on the risk of Alzheimer’s disease.},

	abstract = {Background: Associations between type 2 diabetes (T2D) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ({ALS}) were discovered in observational studies in both European and East Asian populations. However, whether such associations are causal remains largely unknown.
Methods: We employed a two-sample Mendelian randomization approach to evaluate the causal relationship of T2D with the risk of {ALS} in both European and East Asian populations. Our analysis was implemented using summary statistics obtained from large-scale genome-wide association studies with {\textasciitilde}660,000 individuals for T2D and {\textasciitilde}81,000 individuals for {ALS} in the European population, and {\textasciitilde}191,000 individuals for T2D and {\textasciitilde}4100 individuals for {ALS} in the East Asian population. The causal relationship between T2D and {ALS} in both populations was estimated using the inverse-variance-weighted methods and was further validated through extensive complementary and sensitivity analyses.
Results: Using multiple instruments that were strongly associated with T2D, a negative association between T2D and {ALS} was identified in the European population with the odds ratio ({OR}) estimated to be 0.93 (95\% {CI} 0.88–0.99, p = 0.023), while a positive association between T2D and {ALS} was observed in the East Asian population with {OR} = 1.28 (95\% {CI} 0.99–1.62, p = 0.058). These results were robust against instrument selection, various modeling misspecifications, and estimation biases, with the Egger regression and {MR}-{PRESSO} ruling out the possibility of horizontal pleiotropic effects of instruments. However, no causal association was found between T2Drelated exposures (including glycemic traits) and {ALS} in the European population.
Conclusion: Our results provide new evidence supporting the causal neuroprotective role of T2D on {ALS} in the European population and provide empirically suggestive evidence of increasing risk of T2D on {ALS} in the East Asian population. Our results have an important implication on {ALS} pathology, paving ways for developing therapeutic strategies across multiple populations.},
