	abstract = {Instrumental variable analysis is an approach for obtaining causal inferences on the effect of an exposure (risk factor) on an outcome from observational data. It has gained in popularity over the past decade with the use of genetic variants as instrumental variables, known as Mendelian randomization. An instrumental variable is associated with the exposure, but not associated with any confounder of the exposure–outcome association, nor is there any causal pathway from the instrumental variable to the outcome other than via the exposure. Under the assumption that a single instrumental variable or a set of instrumental variables for the exposure is available, the causal effect of the exposure on the outcome can be estimated. There are several methods available for instrumental variable estimation; we consider the ratio method, two-stage methods, likelihood-based methods, and semi-parametric methods. Techniques for obtaining statistical inferences and confidence intervals are presented. The statistical properties of estimates from these methods are compared, and practical advice is given about choosing a suitable analysis method. In particular, bias and coverage properties of estimators are considered, especially with weak instruments. Settings particularly relevant to Mendelian randomization are prioritized in the paper, notably the scenario of a continuous exposure and a continuous or binary outcome.},

	abstract = {We propose a Bayesian approach to Mendelian randomization ({MR}), where instruments are allowed to exert pleiotropic (i.e. not mediated by the exposure) effects on the outcome. By having these effects represented in the model by unknown parameters, and by imposing a shrinkage prior distribution that assumes an unspeciﬁed subset of the effects to be zero, we obtain a proper posterior distribution for the causal effect of interest. This posterior can be sampled via Markov chain Monte Carlo methods of inference to obtain point and interval estimates. The model priors require a minimal input from the user. We explore the performance of our method by means of a simulation experiment. Our results show that the method is reasonably robust to the presence of directional pleiotropy and moderate correlation between the instruments. One section of the article elaborates the model to deal with two exposures, and illustrates the possibility of using {MR} to estimate direct and indirect effects in this situation. A main objective of the article is to create a basis for developments in {MR} that exploit the potential offered by a Bayesian approach to the problem, in relation with the possibility of incorporating external information in the prior, handling multiple sources of uncertainty, and ﬂexibly elaborating the basic model.},

	abstract = {We report genome sequences of 17 inbred strains of laboratory mice and identify almost ten times more variants than previously known. We use these genomes to explore the phylogenetic history of the laboratory mouse and to examine the functional consequences of allele-specific variation on transcript abundance, revealing that at least 12\% of transcripts show a significant tissue-specific expression bias. By identifying candidate functional variants at 718 quantitative trait loci we show that the molecular nature of functional variants and their position relative to genes vary according to the effect size of the locus. These sequences provide a starting point for a new era in the functional analysis of a key model organism. Until the end of the 20th century the molecular basis for mor-phological, physiological, biochemical and behavioural variation in laboratory mice remained largely obscure 1–3 . At the beginning of the 21st century, decoding the complete genome of one strain, C57BL/6J, the mouse reference genome, revolutionized our ability to relate sequence to function 4,5 . It enabled genetic screens in mice to be per-formed on an unprecedented scale 6 , it facilitated the task of creating a complete set of null alleles for all genes 7,8 , and it accelerated the dis-covery of mouse sequence diversity 9,10 . Our catalogues, however, remain incomplete and some forms of variation are largely undocumented. Whereas we now know more about the extent of phenotypic variation among laboratory strains of mice 11–16 and the complexity of genetic action, from fully penetrant Mendelian effects, partially penetrant modifiers 17,18 and non-additive effects 18 , to the quasi-infinitesimal genetic architecture that underlies most quantitative traits 19 , we are still largely ignorant of the molecular basis of the majority of genetically influenced phenotypes.

	doi = {10.1534/genetics.115.180513},
	abstract = {Making predictions about the next 100 years of genetics research is bound to be imprecise and biased, but I am going to stick my neck out anyway and make some shorter-term predictions, some no doubt controversial, about research and likely discoveries in human complex trait genetics. I moved into the field of human complex trait genetics less than 20 years ago, from a background in quantitative ge-netics and animal breeding. Even in this period of time, major changes have occurred that were hard to predict back in the 1990s. Driven by enormous advances in {DNA} sequencing technologies, one can now sequence and analyze an entire human genome for a few thousand dollars. Some may argue that the cost of a sequenced genome is much lower than that, but that usually ignores the expense of storage, analysis, and interpretation. Sequencing technology has facilitated easy and fast discovery of Mendelian disease mutations and coding variants with high penetrance (a high probability of disease given genotype), and has led to precise estimates of the per-generation mutation rate (1000 Genomes Project Consortium et al. 2010). In the same period, development of array geno-typing technology has made it possible to genotype hundreds of thousands of {DNA} variants for less than \$100. Millions of samples have been genotyped using such arrays to study the genetic basis of complex traits such as common disease and quantitative traits, which has led to the discovery of many thousands of genes, gene variants, and biological pathways that are associated with one or more complex traits (Visscher et al. 2012). The traits vary widely, from psychiatric disorders to autoimmune disease, cancer, anthropometric traits such as height and weight, traits measured in blood such as platelet size and counts, and behavioral traits such as intelligence and years of schooling. In addition to trait-variant discovery, the technologies have led to new discoveries in human evolution and population genetics. These mostly unpredicted rapid developments were not just taking place in human complex trait genetics. In plant and animal breeding, a revolution has been taking place in the last 15 years. In 2001, a theoretical paper in this journal showed that with a sufficiently dense marker map, linkage disequi-librium could be exploited to predict breeding values and speed up genetic gain by radically changing the structure of breeding programs (Meuwissen et al. 2001). This paper was published well before the first commercial {SNP} chips were available, and within 10 years of publication, the method, called " genomic selection " (or " genomic prediction "), was implemented in dairy cattle breeding programs around the world; breeders of other livestock species and crops are following the same route. The update of this technology has led to a doubling of the rate of genetic gain in dairy cattle (Veerkamp 2015), an astounding increase and an incredibly rapid up-date of new technology. My main thesis is that the relentless pace of technological innovation will cause a change in how science is conducted. Instead of the model-based hypothesis-testing science that dom-inated the last century, the next will be hypothesis-generating-discovery science that is driven by data. I believe that this change will not be confined to human complex trait genetics, but will apply to all areas of research in genetics. Genomics will become synonymous with biology, a trend already occurring.},

In particular, the limitations of observational epidemiological study including confounding, reverse causation and measurement error can afflict conventional mediation approaches and may lead to incorrect conclusions regarding causal effects. Solutions to analysing mediation which overcome these problems include the use of instrumental variable methods such as Mendelian randomization, which may be applied to evaluate causality in increasingly complex networks of omics data.},

Formulae have been published previously for the variance of actual relationship for a number of specific types of relatives but no general formula for non-inbred individuals is available. We provide here a unified framework that enables the variances for distant relatives to be easily computed, showing, for example, how the variance of sharing for great grandparent-great grandchild, great uncle-great nephew, half uncle-nephew and first cousins differ, even though they have the same expected relationship. Results are extended in order to include differences in map length between sexes, no recombination in males and sex linkage. We derive the magnitude of skew in the proportion shared, showing the skew becomes increasingly large the more distant the relationship. The results obtained for variation in actual relationship apply directly to the variation in actual inbreeding as both are functions of genomic coancestry, and we show how to partition the variation in actual inbreeding between and within families. Although the variance of actual relationship falls as individuals become more distant, its coefficient of variation rises, and so, exacerbated by the skewness, it becomes increasingly difficult to distinguish different pedigree relationships from the actual fraction of the genome shared.},

	abstract = {Mendelian randomization ({MR}) is a popular method in genetic epidemiology to estimate the eﬀect of an exposure on an outcome by using genetic instruments. These instruments are often selected from a combination of prior knowledge from genome wide association studies ({GWAS}) and data-driven instrument selection procedures or tests. Unfortunately, when testing for the exposure eﬀect, the instrument selection process done a priori is not accounted for. This paper studies and highlights the bias resulting from not accounting for the instrument selection process by focusing on a recent data-driven instrument selection procedure, {sisVIVE}, as an example. We introduce a conditional inference approach that conditions on the instrument selection done a priori and leverage recent advances in selective inference to derive conditional null distributions of popular test statistics for the exposure eﬀect in {MR}. The null distributions can be characterized with individual-level or summary-level data in {MR}. We show that our conditional conﬁdence intervals derived from conditional null distributions attain the desired nominal level while typical conﬁdence intervals computed in {MR} do not. We conclude by reanalyzing the eﬀect of {BMI} on diastolic blood pressure using summary-level data from the {UKBiobank} that accounts for instrument selection.},

	abstract = {A transcriptome-wide association study ({TWAS}) integrates data from genome-wide association studies and gene expression mapping studies for investigating the gene regulatory mechanisms underlying diseases. Existing {TWAS} methods are primarily univariate in nature, focusing on analyzing one outcome trait at a time. However, many complex traits are correlated with each other and share a common genetic basis. Consequently, analyzing multiple traits jointly through multivariate analysis can potentially improve the power of {TWASs}. Here, we develop a method, {moPMR}-Egger (multiple outcome probabilistic Mendelian randomization with Egger assumption), for analyzing multiple outcome traits in {TWAS} applications. {moPMR}-Egger examines one gene at a time, relies on its cis-{SNPs} that are in potential linkage disequilibrium with each other to serve as instrumental variables, and tests its causal effects on multiple traits jointly. A key feature of {moPMR}-Egger is its ability to test and control for potential horizontal pleiotropic effects from instruments, thus maximizing power while minimizing false associations for {TWASs}. In simulations, {moPMR}-Egger provides calibrated type I error control for both causal effects testing and horizontal pleiotropic effects testing and is more powerful than existing univariate {TWAS} approaches in detecting causal associations. We apply {moPMR}-Egger to analyze 11 traits from 5 trait categories in the {UK} Biobank. In the analysis, {moPMR}-Egger identiﬁed 13.15\% more gene associations than univariate approaches across trait categories and revealed distinct regulatory mechanisms underlying systolic and diastolic blood pressures.},

Mediation analysis experiences a number of methodological difficulties, including bias due to confounding and measurement error. Mendelian randomisation ({MR}) can be used to improve causal inference for mediation analysis. We describe two approaches that can be used for estimating mediation analysis with {MR}: multivariable Mendelian randomisation ({MVMR}) and two-step Mendelian randomisation. We outline the approaches and provide code to demonstrate how they can be used in mediation analysis. We review issues that can affect analyses, including confounding, measurement error, weak instrument bias, and analysis of multiple mediators. Description of the methods is supplemented by simulated and real data examples. Although Mendelian randomisation relies on large sample sizes and strong assumptions, such as having strong instruments and no horizontally pleiotropic pathways, our examples demonstrate that it is unlikely to be affected by confounders of the exposure or mediator and the outcome, reverse causality and non-differential measurement error of the exposure or mediator. Both {MVMR} and two-step {MR} can be implemented in both individual-level {MR} and summary data {MR}, and can improve causal inference in mediation analysis.},

	abstract = {Mendelian randomization ({MR}) is a common analytic tool for exploring the causal relationship among complex traits. Existing {MR} methods require selecting a small set of single nucleotide polymorphisms ({SNPs}) to serve as instrument variables. However, selecting a small set of {SNPs} may not be ideal, as most complex traits have a polygenic or omnigenic architecture and are each inf luenced by thousands of {SNPs}. Here, motivated by the recent omnigenic hypothesis, we present an {MR} method that uses all genome-wide {SNPs} for causal inference. Our method uses summary statistics from genome-wide association studies as input, accommodates the commonly encountered horizontal pleiotropy effects and relies on a composite likelihood framework for scalable computation. We refer to our method as the omnigenic Mendelian randomization, or {OMR}. We examine the power and robustness of {OMR} through extensive simulations including those under various modeling misspecifications. We apply {OMR} to several real data applications, where we identify multiple complex traits that potentially causally inf luence coronary artery disease ({CAD}) and asthma. The identified new associations reveal important roles of blood lipids, blood pressure and immunity underlying {CAD} as well as important roles of immunity and obesity underlying asthma.},

Several scenarios violating the Mendelian randomization assumptions are described, including settings with inadequate phenotype definition, the setting of time-varying exposures, the presence of gene–environment interaction, the existence of measurement error, the possibility of reverse causation, and the presence of linkage disequilibrium. Data analysis examples are given, illustrating that the inappropriate use of instrumental variable techniques when the Mendelian randomization assumptions are violated can lead to biases of enormous magnitude. To help address some of the strong assumptions being made, three possible approaches are suggested. First, the original proposal of Katan (Lancet. 1986;1:507–508) for Mendelian randomization was not to use instrumental variable techniques to obtain estimates but merely to examine genotype–outcome associations to test for the presence of an effect of the exposure on the outcome. We show that this more modest goal and approach can circumvent many, though not all, the potential biases described. Second, we discuss the use of sensitivity analysis in evaluating the consequences of violations in the assumptions and in attempting to correct for those violations. Third, we suggest that a focus on negative, rather than positive, Mendelian randomization results may turn out to be more reliable.},

	abstract = {Mendelian randomization is a powerful tool for inferring the presence, or otherwise, of causal effects from observational data. However, the nature of genetic variants is such that pleiotropy remains a barrier to valid causal effect estimation. There are many options in the literature for pleiotropy robust methods when studying the effects of a single risk factor on an outcome. However, there are few pleiotropy robust methods in the multivariable setting, that is, when there are multiple risk factors of interest. In this article we introduce three methods which build on common approaches in the univariable setting: {MVMR}-Robust; {MVMR}-Median; and {MVMR}-Lasso. We discuss the properties of each of these methods and examine their performance in comparison to existing approaches in a simulation study. {MVMR}-Robust is shown to outperform existing outlier robust approaches when there are low levels of pleiotropy. {MVMR}-Lasso provides the best estimation in terms of mean squared error for moderate to high levels of pleiotropy, and can provide valid inference in a three sample setting. {MVMR}-Median performs well in terms of estimation across all scenarios considered, and provides valid inference up to a moderate level of pleiotropy. We demonstrate the methods in an applied example looking at the effects of intelligence, education and household income on the risk of Alzheimer’s disease.},

	abstract = {Background: Associations between type 2 diabetes (T2D) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ({ALS}) were discovered in observational studies in both European and East Asian populations. However, whether such associations are causal remains largely unknown.
Methods: We employed a two-sample Mendelian randomization approach to evaluate the causal relationship of T2D with the risk of {ALS} in both European and East Asian populations. Our analysis was implemented using summary statistics obtained from large-scale genome-wide association studies with {\textasciitilde}660,000 individuals for T2D and {\textasciitilde}81,000 individuals for {ALS} in the European population, and {\textasciitilde}191,000 individuals for T2D and {\textasciitilde}4100 individuals for {ALS} in the East Asian population. The causal relationship between T2D and {ALS} in both populations was estimated using the inverse-variance-weighted methods and was further validated through extensive complementary and sensitivity analyses.
Results: Using multiple instruments that were strongly associated with T2D, a negative association between T2D and {ALS} was identified in the European population with the odds ratio ({OR}) estimated to be 0.93 (95\% {CI} 0.88–0.99, p = 0.023), while a positive association between T2D and {ALS} was observed in the East Asian population with {OR} = 1.28 (95\% {CI} 0.99–1.62, p = 0.058). These results were robust against instrument selection, various modeling misspecifications, and estimation biases, with the Egger regression and {MR}-{PRESSO} ruling out the possibility of horizontal pleiotropic effects of instruments. However, no causal association was found between T2Drelated exposures (including glycemic traits) and {ALS} in the European population.
Conclusion: Our results provide new evidence supporting the causal neuroprotective role of T2D on {ALS} in the European population and provide empirically suggestive evidence of increasing risk of T2D on {ALS} in the East Asian population. Our results have an important implication on {ALS} pathology, paving ways for developing therapeutic strategies across multiple populations.},

However, when using multiple genetic variants from different gene regions in a Mendelian randomization analysis, it is highly implausible that all the genetic variants satisfy the instrumental variable assumptions. This means that a simple instrumental variable analysis alone should not be relied on to give a causal conclusion. In this article, we discuss a range of sensitivity analyses that will either support or question the validity of causal inference from a Mendelian randomization analysis with multiple genetic variants. We focus on sensitivity analyses of greatest practical relevance for ensuring robust causal inferences, and those that can be undertaken using summarized data. Aside from cases in which the justification of the instrumental variable assumptions is supported by strong biological understanding, a Mendelian randomization analysis in which no assessment of the robustness of the findings to violations of the instrumental variable assumptions has been made should be viewed as speculative and incomplete. In particular, Mendelian randomization investigations with large numbers of genetic variants without such sensitivity analyses should be treated with skepticism.},

            Mendelian randomization ({MR}) is an epidemiological technique that uses genetic variants to distinguish correlation from causation in observational data. The reliability of a {MR} investigation depends on the validity of the genetic variants as instrumental variables ({IVs}). We develop the contamination mixture method, a method for {MR} with two modalities. First, it identifies groups of genetic variants with similar causal estimates, which may represent distinct mechanisms by which the risk factor influences the outcome. Second, it performs {MR} robustly and efficiently in the presence of invalid {IVs}. Compared to other robust methods, it has the lowest mean squared error across a range of realistic scenarios. The method identifies 11 variants associated with increased high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, decreased triglyceride levels, and decreased coronary heart disease risk that have the same directions of associations with various blood cell traits, suggesting a shared mechanism linking lipids and coronary heart disease risk mediated via platelet aggregation.},

	abstract = {Genome-wide association studies, which typically report regression coefﬁcients summarizing the associations of many genetic variants with various traits, are potentially a powerful source of data for Mendelian randomization investigations. We demonstrate how such coefﬁcients from multiple variants can be combined in a Mendelian randomization analysis to estimate the causal effect of a risk factor on an outcome. The bias and efﬁciency of estimates based on summarized data are compared to those based on individual-level data in simulation studies. We investigate the impact of gene–gene interactions, linkage disequilibrium, and ‘weak instruments’ on these estimates. Both an inverse-variance weighted average of variantspeciﬁc associations and a likelihood-based approach for summarized data give similar estimates and precision to the two-stage least squares method for individual-level data, even when there are gene–gene interactions. However, these summarized data methods overstate precision when variants are in linkage disequilibrium. If the P-value in a linear regression of the risk factor for each variant is less than 1 × 10−5, then weak instrument bias will be small. We use these methods to estimate the causal association of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ({LDL}-C) on coronary artery disease using published data on ﬁve genetic variants. A 30\% reduction in {LDL}-C is estimated to reduce coronary artery disease risk by 67\% (95\% {CI}: 54\% to 76\%). We conclude that Mendelian randomization investigations using summarized data from uncorrelated variants are similarly efﬁcient to those using individual-level data, although the necessary assumptions cannot be so fully assessed.},

However, obtaining reliable results from a Mendelian randomization investigation remains problematic, as the conventional inverse-variance weighted method only gives consistent estimates if all of the genetic variants in the analysis are valid instrumental variables. We present a novel weighted median estimator for combining data on multiple genetic variants into a single causal estimate. This estimator is consistent even when up to 50\% of the information comes from invalid instrumental variables. In a simulation analysis, it is shown to have better ﬁnite-sample Type 1 error rates than the inverse-variance weighted method, and is complementary to the recently proposed {MR}-Egger (Mendelian randomization-Egger) regression method. In analyses of the causal effects of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol on coronary artery disease risk, the inverse-variance weighted method suggests a causal effect of both lipid fractions, whereas the weighted median and {MR}-Egger regression methods suggest a null effect of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol that corresponds with the experimental evidence. Both median-based and {MR}-Egger regression methods should be considered as sensitivity analyses for Mendelian randomization investigations with multiple genetic variants.},

	abstract = {Background: The number of Mendelian randomization analyses including large numbers of genetic variants is rapidly increasing. This is due to the proliferation of genome-wide association studies, and the desire to obtain more precise estimates of causal effects. However, some genetic variants may not be valid instrumental variables, in particular due to them having more than one proximal phenotypic correlate (pleiotropy).
Methods: We view Mendelian randomization with multiple instruments as a meta-analysis, and show that bias caused by pleiotropy can be regarded as analogous to small study bias. Causal estimates using each instrument can be displayed visually by a funnel plot to assess potential asymmetry. Egger regression, a tool to detect small study bias in meta-analysis, can be adapted to test for bias from pleiotropy, and the slope coefﬁcient from Egger regression provides an estimate of the causal effect. Under the assumption that the association of each genetic variant with the exposure is independent of the pleiotropic effect of the variant (not via the exposure), Egger’s test gives a valid test of the null causal hypothesis and a consistent causal effect estimate even when all the genetic variants are invalid instrumental variables.
Results: We illustrate the use of this approach by re-analysing two published Mendelian randomization studies of the causal effect of height on lung function, and the causal effect of blood pressure on coronary artery disease risk. The conservative nature of this approach is illustrated with these examples.
Conclusions: An adaption of Egger regression (which we call {MR}-Egger) can detect some violations of the standard instrumental variable assumptions, and provide an effect estimate which is not subject to these violations. The approach provides a sensitivity analysis for the robustness of the ﬁndings from a Mendelian randomization investigation.},

Of prime focus among the many limitations to {MR} is the unprovable assumption that apparent pleiotropic associations are mediated by the exposure (i.e. reﬂect vertical pleiotropy), and do not arise due to {SNPs} inﬂuencing the two traits through independent pathways (‘horizontal pleiotropy’). The burgeoning treasure trove of genetic associations yielded through genome wide association studies makes for a tantalizing prospect of phenome-wide causal inference. Recent years have seen substantial attention devoted to the problem of horizontal pleiotropy, and in this review we outline how newly developed methods can be used together to improve the reliability of {MR}.},

One of our conclusions is that all {IV} methods encounter problems in the presence of effect modiﬁcation by unobserved confounders.

Classical {IV} analysis assumes linear relationships between the variables, but disease status is often binary and modelled by a logistic regression. When the linearity assumption between the variables does not hold the {IV} estimates will be biased. The extent of this bias in the phenotypedisease log odds ratio of a Mendelian randomization study is investigated.
Methods Three estimators termed direct, standard {IV} and adjusted {IV}, of the phenotype-disease log odds ratio are compared through a simulation study which incorporates unmeasured confounding. The simulations are verified using formulae relating marginal and conditional estimates given in the Appendix.
Results The simulations show that the direct estimator is biased by unmeasured confounding factors and the standard {IV} estimator is attenuated towards the null. Under most circumstances the adjusted {IV} estimator has the smallest bias, although it has inflated type I error when the unmeasured confounders have a large effect.
Conclusions In a Mendelian randomization study with a binary disease outcome the bias associated with estimating the phenotype-disease log odds ratio may be of practical importance and so estimates should be subject to a sensitivity analysis against different amounts of hypothesized confounding.},

	abstract = {Observational epidemiological studies suffer from many potential biases, from confounding and from reverse causation, and this limits their ability to robustly identify causal associations. Several high-proﬁle situations exist in which randomized controlled trials of precisely the same intervention that has been examined in observational studies have produced markedly different ﬁndings. In other observational sciences, the use of instrumental variable ({IV}) approaches has been one approach to strengthening causal inferences in non-experimental situations. The use of germline genetic variants that proxy for environmentally modiﬁable exposures as instruments for these exposures is one form of {IV} analysis that can be implemented within observational epidemiological studies. The method has been referred to as ‘Mendelian randomization’, and can be considered as analogous to randomized controlled trials. This paper outlines Mendelian randomization, draws parallels with {IV} methods, provides examples of implementation of the approach and discusses limitations of the approach and some methods for dealing with these.

Randomized controlled trials to investigate this effect are not always possible and inferences based on observational data can be confounded. However, if we know of a gene closely linked to the phenotype without direct effect on the disease, it can often be reasonably assumed that the gene is not itself associated with any confounding factors — a phenomenon called Mendelian randomization. These properties define an instrumental variable and allow estimation of the causal effect, despite the confounding, under certain model restrictions. In this paper, we present a formal framework for causal inference based on Mendelian randomization and suggest using directed acyclic graphs to check model assumptions by visual inspection. This framework allows us to address limitations of the Mendelian randomization technique that have often been overlooked in the medical literature.},

This means that a simple instrumental variable analysis alone should not be relied on to give a causal conclusion. In this article, we discuss a range of sensitivity analyses that will either support or question the validity of causal inference from a Mendelian randomization analysis with multiple genetic variants. We focus on sensitivity analyses of greatest practical relevance for ensuring robust causal inferences, and those that can be undertaken using summarized data. Aside from cases in which the justification of the instrumental variable assumptions is supported by strong biological understanding, a Mendelian randomization analysis in which no assessment of the robustness of the findings to violations of the instrumental variable assumptions has been made should be viewed as speculative and incomplete.

            Mendelian randomization ({MR}) is a common tool for identifying causal risk factors underlying diseases. Here, we present a method, {MRAID}, for effective {MR} analysis. {MRAID} borrows ideas from fine mapping analysis to model an initial set of candidate {SNPs} that are in potentially high linkage disequilibrium with each other and automatically selects among them the suitable instruments for causal inference. {MRAID} also explicitly models both uncorrelated and correlated horizontal pleiotropic effects that are widespread for complex trait analysis. {MRAID} achieves both tasks through a joint likelihood framework and relies on a scalable sampling-based algorithm to compute calibrated
            p
            -values. Comprehensive and realistic simulations show {MRAID} can provide calibrated type I error control, reduce false positives, while being more powerful than existing approaches. We illustrate the benefits of {MRAID} for an {MR} screening analysis across 645 trait pairs in {UK} Biobank, identifying multiple lifestyle causal risk factors of cardiovascular disease-related traits.},

Power and {IV} strength requirements for {MR} studies using multiple genetic variants have not been explored.
Methods We simulated cohort data sets consisting of a normally distributed disease trait, a normally distributed exposure, which affects this trait and a biallelic genetic variant that affects the exposure. We estimated power to detect an effect of exposure on disease for varying allele frequencies, effect sizes and samples sizes (using two-stage least squares regression on 10 000 data sets—Stage 1 is a regression of exposure on the variant. Stage 2 is a regression of disease on the fitted exposure). Similar analyses were conducted using multiple genetic variants (5, 10, 20) as independent or combined {IVs}. We assessed {IV} strength using the first-stage F statistic.
Results Simulations of realistic scenarios indicate that {MR} studies will require large (n41000), often very large (n410 000), sample sizes. In many cases, so-called ‘weak {IV}’ problems arise when using multiple variants as independent {IVs} (even with as few as five), resulting in biased effect estimates. Combining genetic factors into fewer {IVs} results in modest power decreases, but alleviates weak {IV} problems. Ideal methods for combining genetic factors depend upon knowledge of the genetic architecture underlying the exposure.
Conclusions The feasibility of well-powered, unbiased {MR} studies will depend upon the amount of variance in the exposure that can be explained by known genetic factors and the ‘strength’ of the {IV} set derived from these genetic factors.},

This parameter-expanded Ei M, {PX}-{EM}, algorithm shares the simplicity and stability of ordinary {EM}, but has a faster rate of convergence since its M step performs a more efficient analysis.

	abstract = {Background Mendelian randomization is used to test and estimate the magnitude of a causal effect of a phenotype on an outcome by using genetic variants as instrumental variables ({IVs}). Estimates of association from {IV} analysis are biased in the direction of the confounded, observational association between phenotype and outcome. The magnitude of the bias depends on the F-statistic for the strength of relationship between {IVs} and phenotype. We seek to develop guidelines for the design and analysis of Mendelian randomization studies to minimize bias.
Methods {IV} analysis was performed on simulated and real data to investigate the effect on bias of size of study, number and choice of instruments and method of analysis.
Results Bias is shown to increase as the expected F-statistic decreases, and can be reduced by using parsimonious models of genetic association (i.e. not over-parameterized) and by adjusting for measured covariates. Using data from a single study, the causal estimate of a unit increase in log-transformed C-reactive protein on fibrinogen (mmol/l) is shown to increase from À0.005 (P ¼ 0.99) to 0.792 (P ¼ 0.00003) due to injudicious choice of instrument. Moreover, when the observed F-statistic is larger than expected in a particular study, the causal estimate is more biased towards the observational association and its standard error is smaller. This correlation between causal estimate and standard error introduces a second source of bias into meta-analysis of Mendelian randomization studies. Bias can be alleviated in meta-analyses by using individual level data and by pooling genetic effects across studies.
Conclusions Weak instrument bias is of practical importance for the design and analysis of Mendelian randomization studies. Post hoc choice of instruments, genetic models or data based on measured F-statistics can exacerbate bias. In particular, the commonly cited rule of thumb that F410 avoids bias in {IV} analysis is misleading.},

	abstract = {Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ({ALS}) is a late-onset fatal neurodegenerative disorder that is predicted to increase across the globe by ∼70\% in the following decades. Understanding the disease causal mechanism underlying {ALS} and identifying modifiable risks factors for {ALS} hold the key for the development of effective preventative and treatment strategies. Here, we investigate the causal effects of four blood lipid traits that include high-density lipoprotein, low-density lipoprotein ({LDL}), total cholesterol and triglycerides on the risk of {ALS}. By leveraging instrument variables from multiple large-scale genome-wide association studies in both European and East Asian populations, we carry out one of the largest and most comprehensive Mendelian randomization analyses performed to date on the causal relationship between lipids and {ALS}. Among the four lipids, we found that only {LDL} is causally associated with {ALS} and that higher {LDL} level increases the risk of {ALS} in both the European and East Asian populations. Specifically, the odds ratio of {ALS} per 1 standard deviation (i.e. 39.0 mg/{dL}) increase of {LDL} is estimated to be 1.14 [95\% confidence interval ({CI}), 1.05–1.24; P = 1.38E-3] in the European population and 1.06 (95\% {CI}, 1.00–1.12; P = 0.044) in the East Asian population. The identified causal relationship between {LDL} and {ALS} is robust with respect to the choice of statistical methods and is validated through extensive sensitivity analyses that guard against various model assumption violations. Our study provides important evidence supporting the causal role of higher {LDL} on increasing the risk of {ALS}, paving ways for the development of preventative strategies for reducing the disease burden of {ALS} across multiple nations.},

	abstract = {In epidemiological research, the causal effect of a modifiable phenotype or exposure on a disease is often of public health interest. Randomized controlled trials to investigate this effect are not always possible and inferences based on observational data can be confounded. However, if we know of a gene closely linked to the phenotype without direct effect on the disease, it can often be reasonably assumed that the gene is not itself associated with any confounding factors — a phenomenon called Mendelian randomization. These properties define an instrumental variable and allow estimation of the causal effect, despite the confounding, under certain model restrictions. In this paper, we present a formal framework for causal inference based on Mendelian randomization and suggest using directed acyclic graphs to check model assumptions by visual inspection. This framework allows us to address limitations of the Mendelian randomization technique that have often been overlooked in the medical literature.},

	abstract = {Background: Mendelian randomization ({MR}) applies instrumental variable ({IV}) methods to observational data using a genetic variant as an {IV}. Several Monte‐Carlo studies investigate the performance of {MR} methods with binary outcomes, but few consider them in conjunction with binary risk factors.
Objective: To develop a novel {MR} estimator for scenarios with a binary risk factor and outcome; and compare to existing {MR} estimators via simulations and real data analysis.
Methods: A bivariate Bernoulli distribution is adapted to the {IV} setting. Empirical bias and asymptotic coverage probabilities are estimated via simulations. The proposed method is compared to the Wald method, two‐stage predictor substitution (2SPS), two‐stage residual inclusion (2SRI), and the generalized method of moments ({GMM}). An analysis is performed using existing data from the {CLEAR} study to estimate the potential causal effect of smoking on rheumatoid arthritis risk in African Americans.
Results: Bias was low for the proposed method and comparable to 2SPS. The Wald method was often biased towards the null. Coverage was adequate for the proposed method, 2SPS, and 2SRI. Coverage for the Wald and {GMM} methods was poor in several scenarios. The causal effect of ever smoking on rheumatoid arthritis risk was not statistically significant using a variety of genetic instruments.
Conclusions: Simulations suggest the proposed {MR} method is sound with binary risk factors and outcomes, and comparable to 2SPS and 2SRI in terms of bias. The proposed method also provides more natural framework for hypothesis testing compared to 2SPS or 2SRI, which require ad‐hoc variance adjustments.},

	abstract = {This paper analyzes the conditions under which consistent estimation can be achieved in instrumental variables ({IV}) regression when the available instruments are weak and the number of instruments, Kn, goes to inﬁnity with the sample size. We show that consistent estimation depends importantly on the strength of the instruments as measured by rn, the rate of growth of the so-called concentration parameter, and also on Kn. In particular, when Kn → ∞, the concentration parameter can grow, even if each individual instrument is only weakly correlated with the endogenous explanatory variables, and consistency of certain estimators can be established under weaker conditions than have previously been assumed in the literature. Hence, the use of many weak instruments may actually improve the performance of certain point estimators. More speciﬁcally, we ﬁnd that the limited information maximum likelihood ({LIML}) estimator an√d the bias-corrected two-stage least squares (B2SLS) estimator are consistent when Kn/rn → 0 while the two-stage least squares (2SLS) estimator is consistent only if Kn/rn → 0 as n → ∞. These consistency results suggest that {LIML} and B2SLS are more robust to instrument weakness than 2SLS.},

	abstract = {Mendelian randomization ({MR}) is an increasingly important tool for appraising causality in observational epidemiology. The technique exploits the principle that genotypes are not generally susceptible to reverse causation bias and confounding, reﬂecting their ﬁxed nature and Mendel’s ﬁrst and second laws of inheritance. The approach is, however, subject to important limitations and assumptions that, if unaddressed or compounded by poor study design, can lead to erroneous conclusions. Nevertheless, the advent of 2-sample approaches (in which exposure and outcome are measured in separate samples) and the increasing availability of open-access data from large consortia of genome-wide association studies and population biobanks mean that the approach is likely to become routine practice in evidence synthesis and causal inference research. In this article we provide an overview of the design, analysis, and interpretation of {MR} studies, with a special emphasis on assumptions and limitations. We also consider different analytic strategies for strengthening causal inference. Although impossible to prove causality with any single approach, {MR} is a highly cost-effective strategy for prioritizing intervention targets for disease prevention and for strengthening the evidence base for public health policy.

Different approaches to the study of pleiotropy have led to incongruence in the way that it is perceived and discussed among researchers in these ﬁelds. Furthermore, our understanding of the term has changed quite a bit since 1910, particularly in light of modern molecular data.

The principles of {MR} are based on Mendel’s laws of inheritance and instrumental variable estimation methods, which enable the inference of causal effects in the presence of unobserved confounding. In this Primer, we outline the principles of {MR}, the instrumental variable conditions underlying {MR} estimation and some of the methods used for estimation. We go on to discuss how the assumptions underlying an {MR} study can be assessed and describe methods of estimation that are robust to certain violations of these assumptions. We give examples of a range of studies in which {MR} has been applied, the limitations of current methods of analysis and the outlook for {MR} in the future. The differences between the assumptions required for {MR} analysis and other forms of epidemiological studies means that {MR} can be used as part of a triangulation across multiple sources of evidence for causal inference.},

	abstract = {We introduce a new Empirical Bayes approach for large-scale hypothesis testing, including estimating false discovery rates ({FDRs}), and effect sizes. This approach has two key differences from existing approaches to {FDR} analysis. First, it assumes that the distribution of the actual (unobserved) effects is unimodal, with a mode at 0. This “unimodal assumption” ({UA}), although natural in many contexts, is not usually incorporated into standard {FDR} analysis, and we demonstrate how incorporating it brings many beneﬁts. Speciﬁcally, the {UA} facilitates efﬁcient and robust computation—estimating the unimodal distribution involves solving a simple convex optimization problem—and enables more accurate inferences provided that it holds. Second, the method takes as its input two numbers for each test (an effect size estimate and corresponding standard error), rather than the one number usually used (p value or z score). When available, using two numbers instead of one helps account for variation in measurement precision across tests. It also facilitates estimation of effects, and unlike standard {FDR} methods, our approach provides interval estimates (credible regions) for each effect in addition to measures of signiﬁcance. To provide a bridge between interval estimates and signiﬁcance measures, we introduce the term “local false sign rate” to refer to the probability of getting the sign of an effect wrong and argue that it is a superior measure of signiﬁcance than the local {FDR} because it is both more generally applicable and can be more robustly estimated. Our methods are implemented in an R package ashr available from http://github.com/stephens999/ashr.},

As a byproduct of our calculations, we also obtain approximate standard errors for estimated predictive errors and for comparison of predictive errors between two models.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Recent clinical guidelines support intensive blood pressure treatment targets. However, observational data suggest that excessive diastolic blood pressure ({DBP}) lowering might increase the risk of myocardial infarction ({MI}), reflecting a J- or U-shaped relationship.
{METHODS}: We analyzed 47 407 participants from 5 cohorts (median age, 60 years). First, to corroborate previous observational analyses, we used traditional statistical methods to test the shape of association between {DBP} and cardiovascular disease ({CVD}). Second, we created polygenic risk scores of {DBP} and systolic blood pressure and generated linear Mendelian randomization ({MR}) estimates for the effect of {DBP} on {CVD}. Third, using novel nonlinear {MR} approaches, we evaluated for nonlinearity in the genetic relationship between {DBP} and {CVD} events. Comprehensive {MR} interrogation of {DBP} required us to also model systolic blood pressure, given that the 2 are strongly correlated.
{RESULTS}: Traditional observational analysis of our cohorts suggested a J-shaped association between {DBP} and {MI}. By contrast, linear {MR} analyses demonstrated an adverse effect of increasing {DBP} increments on {CVD} outcomes, including {MI} ({MI} hazard ratio, 1.07 per unit mm Hg increase in {DBP}; P{\textless}0.001). Furthermore, nonlinear {MR} analyses found no evidence for a J-shaped relationship; instead confirming that {MI} risk decreases consistently per unit decrease in {DBP}, even among individuals with low values of baseline {DBP}.
{CONCLUSIONS}: In this analysis of the genetic effect of {DBP}, we found no evidence for a nonlinear J- or U-shaped relationship between {DBP} and adverse {CVD} outcomes; including {MI}.},

	abstract = {Backgrounds: Elucidating the causal eﬀects of common intermediate risk factors on the onset of age-related diseases is indispensable for developing prevention and intervention procedures.
Methods: We conducted two-stage time-to-event Mendelian randomization meta-analyses combining ﬁve largescale longitudinal cohorts to investigate dynamic causal eﬀects of cardiovascular disease risk factors including body mass index ({BMI}), systolic blood pressure ({SBP}), and lipids on the age-at-onset of age-related diseases. We constructed weighted polygenic scores based on genetic markers from previously reported genome-wide association studies as instrumental variables to estimate the causal eﬀects. To avoid false positive due to potential pleiotropic eﬀects of the genetic markers, we performed a leave-one-out sensitivity analysis and an {MR}-Egger sensitivity analysis that we expanded in the survival context.
Results: Our results show that elevated {BMI} increases the absolute risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D) (p = 7.68e −04), heart failure (p = 9.03e −03), and cardiovascular diseases ({CVD}) (p = 1.69e− 03) and the causal eﬀects start at diﬀerent ages. A signiﬁcant association between {BMI} and the risk of stroke is observed; however, the sensitivity analyses suggest that the association is attributed to the potential pleiotropic eﬀects of rs2867125 and rs1558902. Raised {SBP} levels are signiﬁcantly associated with the development of atrial ﬁbrillation (p = 6.42e −03). Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ({LDL}-C) levels are inversely associated with the age-at-onset of T2D (p = 1.05e− 02). In addition, {LDL}-C and triglycerides are inversely associated with the risks of cancer and T2D, respectively. Nevertheless, the sensitivity analyses suggest that these associations are probably due to pleiotropic eﬀects of several single-nucleotide polymorphisms including rs4970834 and rs1260326.
Conclusions: Our results highlight the involvement of {BMI} in the development of multiple age-related diseases. Some observed causal associations can attribute to pleiotropic eﬀects of some genetic variations. These ﬁndings have important implications in unraveling causal eﬀects of common risk factors on age-related diseases and guiding eﬀective intervention strategies to reduce the incidence of these diseases.},

These single-cell analyses will allow researchers to uncover new and potentially unexpected biological discoveries relative to traditional proﬁling methods that assess bulk populations. Single-cell {RNA} sequencing ({scRNA}-seq), for example, can reveal complex and rare cell populations, uncover regulatory relationships between genes, and track the trajectories of distinct cell lineages in development. In this review, we will focus on technical challenges in single-cell isolation and library preparation and on computational analysis pipelines available for analyzing {scRNA}-seq data. Further technical improvements at the level of molecular and cell biology and in available bioinformatics tools will greatly facilitate both the basic science and medical applications of these sequencing technologies.},

In addition to the classical methods of differential protein gel or blot staining by dyes and fluorophores, mass-spectrometry-based quantification methods have gained increasing popularity over the past five years. Most of these methods employ differential stable isotope labeling to create a specific mass tag that can be recognized by a mass spectrometer and at the same time provide the basis for quantification. These mass tags can be introduced into proteins or peptides (i) metabolically, (ii) by chemical means, (iii) enzymatically, or (iv) provided by spiked synthetic peptide standards. In contrast, label-free quantification approaches aim to correlate the mass spectrometric signal of intact proteolytic peptides or the number of peptide sequencing events with the relative or absolute protein quantity directly. In this review, we critically examine the more commonly used quantitative mass spectrometry methods for their individual merits and discuss challenges in arriving at meaningful interpretations of quantitative proteomic data.},

	doi = {10.1214/20-STS802},
	abstract = {Mendelian randomization ({MR}) is a popular instrumental variable ({IV}) approach, in which one or several genetic markers serve as {IVs} that can sometimes be leveraged to recover valid inferences about a given exposure-outcome causal association subject to unmeasured confounding. A key {IV} identiﬁcation condition known as the exclusion restriction states that the {IV} cannot have a direct effect on the outcome which is not mediated by the exposure in view. In {MR} studies, such an assumption requires an unrealistic level of prior knowledge about the mechanism by which genetic markers causally affect the outcome. As a result, possible violation of the exclusion restriction can seldom be ruled out in practice. To address this concern, we introduce a new class of {IV} estimators which are robust to violation of the exclusion restriction under data generating mechanisms commonly assumed in {MR} literature. The proposed approach named “{MR} G-Estimation under No Interaction with Unmeasured Selection” ({MR} {GENIUS}) improves on Robins’ G-estimation by making it robust to both additive unmeasured confounding and violation of the exclusion restriction assumption. In certain key settings, {MR} {GENIUS} reduces to the estimator of Lewbel (J. Bus. Econom. Statist. 30 (2012) 67–80) which is widely used in econometrics but appears largely unappreciated in {MR} literature. More generally, {MR} {GENIUS} generalizes Lewbel’s estimator to several key practical {MR} settings, including multiplicative causal models for binary outcome, multiplicative and odds ratio exposure models, case control study design and censored survival outcomes.},

	abstract = {Mendelian randomization ({MR}) is an application of instrumental variable ({IV}) methods to observational data in which the {IV} is a genetic variant. {MR} methods applicable to the general exponential family of distributions are currently not well characterized. We adapt a general linear model framework to the {IV} setting and propose a general {MR} method applicable to any full‐rank distribution from the exponential family. Empirical bias and coverage are estimated via simulations. The proposed method is compared to several existing {MR} methods. Real data analyses are performed using data from the {REGARDS} study to estimate the potential causal effect of smoking frequency on stroke risk in African Americans. In simulations with binary variates and very weak instruments the proposed method had the lowest median [Q1, Q3] bias (0.10 [−3.68 to 3.62]); compared with 2SPS (0.27 [−3.74 to 4.26]) and the Wald method (−0.69 [−1.72 to 0.35]). Low bias was observed throughout other simulation scenarios; as well as more than 90\% coverage for the proposed method. In simulations with count variates, the proposed method performed comparably to 2SPS; the Wald method maintained the most consistent low bias; and 2SRI was biased towards the null. Real data analyses find no evidence for a causal effect of smoking frequency on stroke risk. The proposed {MR} method has low bias and acceptable coverage across a wide range of distributional scenarios and instrument strengths; and provides a more parsimonious framework for asymptotic hypothesis testing compared to existing two‐stage procedures.},

Conventional analyses of this relationship are susceptible to omitted variable bias from variables that jointly influence both hospital admission and adipose status. We implement a novel {quasiPoisson} instrumental variable model in a Mendelian randomization framework, identifying causal effects from random perturbations to germline genetic variation. We estimate the individual and joint effects of {BMI}, {WHR}, and {WHR} adjusted for {BMI}. We also implement multivariable instrumental variable methods in which the causal effect of one exposure is estimated conditionally on the causal effect of another exposure. Data on 310,471 participants and over 550,000 inpatient admissions in the {UK} Biobank were used to perform one-sample and twosample Mendelian randomization analyses. The results supported a causal role of adiposity on hospital admis­ sions, with consistency across all estimates and sensitivity analyses. Point estimates were generally larger than estimates from comparable observational specifications. We observed an attenuation of the {BMI} effect when adjusting for {WHR} in the multivariable Mendelian randomization analyses, suggesting that an adverse fat dis­ tribution, rather than a higher {BMI} itself, may drive the relationship between adiposity and risk of hospital admission.},

	abstract = {Background: There is increasing evidence that elevated body mass index ({BMI}) is associated with reduced survival for women with breast cancer. However, the underlying reasons remain unclear. We conducted a Mendelian randomization analysis to investigate a possible causal role of {BMI} in survival from breast cancer.
Methods: We used individual-level data from six large breast cancer case-cohorts including a total of 36 210 individuals (2475 events) of European ancestry. We created a {BMI} genetic risk score ({GRS}) based on genotypes at 94 known {BMI}-associated genetic variants. Association between the {BMI} genetic score and breast cancer survival was analysed by Cox regression for each study separately. Study-speciﬁc hazard ratios were pooled using ﬁxed-effect meta-analysis.
Results: {BMI} genetic score was found to be associated with reduced breast cancer-speciﬁc survival for estrogen receptor ({ER})-positive cases [hazard ratio ({HR}) ¼ 1.11, per one-unit increment of {GRS}, 95\% conﬁdence interval ({CI}) 1.01–1.22, P ¼ 0.03). We observed no association for {ER}-negative cases ({HR} ¼ 1.00, per one-unit increment of {GRS}, 95\% {CI} 0.89–1.13, P ¼ 0.95).
Conclusions: Our ﬁndings suggest a causal effect of increased {BMI} on reduced breast cancer survival for {ER}-positive breast cancer. There is no evidence of a causal effect of higher {BMI} on survival for {ER}-negative breast cancer cases.},
