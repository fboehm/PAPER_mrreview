	abstract = {The use of genetic variants as instrumental variables – an approach known as Mendelian randomization – is a popular epidemiological method for estimating the causal effect of an exposure (phenotype, biomarker, risk factor) on a disease or health-related outcome from observational data. Instrumental variables must satisfy strong, often untestable assumptions, which means that finding good genetic instruments among a large list of potential candidates is challenging. This difficulty is compounded by the fact that many genetic variants influence more than one phenotype through different causal pathways, a phenomenon called horizontal pleiotropy. This leads to errors not only in estimating the magnitude of the causal effect but also in inferring the direction of the putative causal link. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian approach called {BAYESMR} that is a generalization of the Mendelian randomization technique in which we allow for pleiotropic effects and, crucially, for the possibility of reverse causation. The output of the method is a posterior distribution over the target causal effect, which provides an immediate and easily interpretable measure of the uncertainty in the estimation. More importantly, we use Bayesian model averaging to determine how much more likely the inferred direction is relative to the reverse direction.},

However, 2SMR methods are evolving rapidly and {GWAS} results are often insufficiently curated, undermining efficient implementation of the approach. We therefore developed {MR}-Base (
              http://www.mrbase.org
              ): a platform that integrates a curated database of complete {GWAS} results (no restrictions according to statistical significance) with an application programming interface, web app and R packages that automate 2SMR. The software includes several sensitivity analyses for assessing the impact of horizontal pleiotropy and other violations of assumptions. The database currently comprises 11 billion single nucleotide polymorphism-trait associations from 1673 {GWAS} and is updated on a regular basis. Integrating data with software ensures more rigorous application of hypothesis-driven analyses and allows millions of potential causal relationships to be efficiently evaluated in phenome-wide association studies.

            Our health is affected by many exposures and risk factors, including aspects of our lifestyles, our environments, and our biology. It can, however, be hard to work out the causes of health outcomes because ill-health can influence risk factors and risk factors tend to influence each other. To work out whether particular interventions influence health outcomes, scientists will ideally conduct a so-called randomized controlled trial, where some randomly-chosen participants are given an intervention that modifies the risk factor and others are not. But this type of experiment can be expensive or impractical to conduct.
            Alternatively, scientists can also use genetics to mimic a randomized controlled trial. This technique – known as Mendelian randomization – is possible for two reasons. First, because it is essentially random whether a person has one version of a gene or another. Second, because our genes influence different risk factors. For example, people with one version of a gene might be more likely to drink alcohol than people with another version. Researchers can compare people with different versions of the gene to infer what effect alcohol drinking has on their health.
            Every day, new studies investigate the role of genetic variants in human health, which scientists can draw on for research using Mendelian randomization. But until now, complete results from these studies have not been organized in one place. At the same time, statistical methods for Mendelian randomization are continually being developed and improved. To take advantage of these advances, Hemani, Zheng, Elsworth et al. produced a computer programme and online platform called “{MR}-Base”, combining up-to-date genetic data with the latest statistical methods.
            {MR}-Base automates the process of Mendelian randomization, making research much faster: analyses that previously could have taken months can now be done in minutes. It also makes studies more reliable, reducing the risk of human error and ensuring scientists use the latest methods. {MR}-Base contains over 11 billion associations between people’s genes and health-related outcomes. This will allow researchers to investigate many potential causes of poor health. As new statistical methods and new findings from genetic studies are added to {MR}-Base, its value to researchers will grow.},

            In Mendelian randomization ({MR}) analysis, variants that exert horizontal pleiotropy are typically treated as a nuisance. However, they could be valuable in identifying alternative pathways to the traits under investigation. Here, we develop {MR}-{TRYX}, a framework that exploits horizontal pleiotropy to discover putative risk factors for disease. We begin by detecting outliers in a single exposure–outcome {MR} analysis, hypothesising they are due to horizontal pleiotropy. We search across hundreds of complete {GWAS} summary datasets to systematically identify other (candidate) traits that associate with the outliers. We develop a multi-trait pleiotropy model of the heterogeneity in the exposure–outcome analysis due to pathways through candidate traits. Through detailed investigation of several causal relationships, many pleiotropic pathways are uncovered with already established causal effects, validating the approach, but also alternative putative causal pathways. Adjustment for pleiotropic pathways reduces the heterogeneity across the analyses.},

	abstract = {Background: Mendelian randomization ({MR}) is being increasingly used to strengthen causal inference in observational studies. Availability of summary data of genetic associations for a variety of phenotypes from large genome-wide association studies ({GWAS}) allows straightforward application of {MR} using summary data methods, typically in a two-sample design. In addition to the conventional inverse variance weighting ({IVW}) method, recently developed summary data {MR} methods, such as the {MR}-Egger and weighted median approaches, allow a relaxation of the instrumental variable assumptions.
Methods: Here, a new method - the mode-based estimate ({MBE}) - is proposed to obtain a single causal effect estimate from multiple genetic instruments. The {MBE} is consistent when the largest number of similar (identical in inﬁnite samples) individual-instrument causal effect estimates comes from valid instruments, even if the majority of instruments are invalid. We evaluate the performance of the method in simulations designed to mimic the two-sample summary data setting, and demonstrate its use by investigating the causal effect of plasma lipid fractions and urate levels on coronary heart disease risk.
Results: The {MBE} presented less bias and lower type-I error rates than other methods under the null in many situations. Its power to detect a causal effect was smaller compared with the {IVW} and weighted median methods, but was larger than that of {MR}-Egger regression, with sample size requirements typically smaller than those available from {GWAS} consortia.
Conclusions: The {MBE} relaxes the instrumental variable assumptions, and should be used in combination with other approaches in sensitivity analyses.},

	abstract = {Background An allele score is a single variable summarizing multiple genetic variants associated with a risk factor. It is calculated as the total number of risk factor-increasing alleles for an individual (unweighted score), or the sum of weights for each allele corresponding to estimated genetic effect sizes (weighted score). An allele score can be used in a Mendelian randomization analysis to estimate the causal effect of the risk factor on an outcome.
Methods Data were simulated to investigate the use of allele scores in Mendelian randomization where conventional instrumental variable techniques using multiple genetic variants demonstrate ‘weak instrument’ bias. The robustness of estimates using the allele score to misspecification (for example non-linearity, effect modification) and to violations of the instrumental variable assumptions was assessed.
Results Causal estimates using a correctly specified allele score were unbiased with appropriate coverage levels. The estimates were generally robust to misspecification of the allele score, but not to instrumental variable violations, even if the majority of variants in the allele score were valid instruments. Using a weighted rather than an unweighted allele score increased power, but the increase was small when genetic variants had similar effect sizes. Naive use of the data under analysis to choose which variants to include in an allele score, or for deriving weights, resulted in substantial biases.
Conclusions Allele scores enable valid causal estimates with large numbers of genetic variants. The stringency of criteria for genetic variants in Mendelian randomization should be maintained for all variants in an allele score.},

	abstract = {A major, often unstated, concern of researchers carrying out epidemiological studies of medical therapy is the potential impact on validity if estimates of treatment are biased due to unmeasured confounders. One technique for obtaining consistent estimates of treatment effects in the presence of unmeasured confounders is instrumental variables analysis ({IVA}). This technique has been well developed in the econometrics literature and is being increasingly used in epidemiological studies. However, the approach to {IVA} that is most commonly used in such studies is based on linear models, while many epidemiological applications make use of non-linear models, speciﬁcally generalized linear models ({GLMs}) such as logistic or Poisson regression. Here we present a simple method for applying {IVA} within the class of {GLMs} using the generalized method of moments approach. We explore some of the theoretical properties of the method and illustrate its use within both a simulation example and an epidemiological study where unmeasured confounding is suspected to be present. We estimate the effects of beta-blocker therapy on one-year all-cause mortality after an incident hospitalization for heart failure, in the absence of data describing disease severity, which is believed to be a confounder.

	abstract = {Background Randomized trials provide pivotal evidence for evaluation and approval of therapies. Nonetheless, such trials are often plagued by noncompliance, especially in the form of premature discontinuation of treatment. While intentto-treat ({ITT}) analysis can provide valid tests of no-effect hypotheses, some trials may make {ITT} analysis impossible by ceasing follow-up when patients go off assigned treatment. Furthermore, estimates based on {ITT}, on-treatment, or per-protocol comparisons can seriously understate harm or benefit.
Purpose To show how g-estimation based on randomization status is a natural generalization of {ITT} null testing to estimating efficacy from trials with important discontinuation or noncompliance.
Methods We contrast with an analysis of the effect of a tiotropium inhaler on the occurrence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ({COPD}) events in a six-month double-blind placebo-controlled trial of 1829 patients with good but imperfect compliance.
Results The covariate-adjusted point estimates, 95\% confidence limits ({CL}), and null P-values comparing expected {COPD} event times in placebo versus tiotropium patients were: {ITT}, 1.21, {CL} ¼ 1.02, 1.43, P ¼ 0.027; on-treatment, 1.27, {CL} ¼ 1.06, 1.52, P ¼ 0.009; per-protocol, 1.36, {CL} ¼ 1.13, 1.63, P ¼ 0.001; and g-estimation, 1.31, {CL} ¼ 1.03,1.72, P ¼ 0.027. Thus g-estimation preserved the {ITT} test of the null, but exhibited more uncertainty about the size of the tiotropium effect than the other methods. In particular, it allowed for a much larger potential effect than did {ITT} analysis, but produced a much larger null P than exhibited by per-protocol analysis. Limitations Like {ITT} analysis, g-estimation requires all patients be followed to the end of the trial protocol, regardless of whether they comply with the protocol. Like on-treatment and per-protocol analyses, it also requires accurate compliance information be recorded.
Conclusion G-estimation should become a standard procedure for the analysis of trials with noncompliance. Software to do so is available in major packages, and the procedure is easily coded for other packages. Clinical Trials 2008; 5: 5–13. http://ctj.sagepub.com},

	abstract = {Background: The {MR}-Egger ({MRE}) estimator has been proposed to correct for directional pleiotropic effects of genetic instruments in an instrumental variable ({IV}) analysis. The power of this method is considerably lower than that of conventional estimators, limiting its applicability. Here we propose a novel Bayesian implementation of the {MR}-Egger estimator ({BMRE}) and explore the utility of applying weakly informative priors on the intercept term (the pleiotropy estimate) to increase power of the {IV} (slope) estimate.
Methods: This was a simulation study to compare the performance of different {IV} estimators. Scenarios differed in the presence of a causal effect, the presence of pleiotropy, the proportion of pleiotropic instruments and degree of ‘Instrument Strength Independent of Direct Effect’ ({InSIDE}) assumption violation. Based on empirical plasma urate data, we present an approach to elucidate a prior distribution for the amount of pleiotropy.
Results: A weakly informative prior on the intercept term increased power of the slope estimate while maintaining type 1 error rates close to the nominal value of 0.05. Under the {InSIDE} assumption, performance was unaffected by the presence or absence of pleiotropy. Violation of the {InSIDE} assumption biased all estimators, affecting the {BMRE} more than the {MRE} method.
Conclusions: Depending on the prior distribution, the {BMRE} estimator has more power at the cost of an increased susceptibility to {InSIDE} assumption violations. As such the {BMRE} method is a compromise between the {MRE} and conventional {IV} estimators, and may be an especially useful approach to account for observed pleiotropy.},

	abstract = {A major application for genome-wide association studies ({GWAS}) has been the emerging ﬁeld of causal inference using Mendelian randomization ({MR}), where the causal eﬀect between a pair of traits can be estimated using only summary level data. {MR} depends on {SNPs} exhibiting vertical pleiotropy, where the {SNP} inﬂuences an outcome phenotype only through an exposure phenotype. Issues arise when this assumption is violated due to {SNPs} exhibiting horizontal pleiotropy. We demonstrate that across a range of pleiotropy models, instrument selection will be increasingly liable to selecting invalid instruments as {GWAS} sample sizes continue to grow. Methods have been developed in an attempt to protect {MR} from diﬀerent patterns of horizontal pleiotropy, and here we have designed a mixture-of-experts machine learning framework ({MR}-{MoE} 1.0) that predicts the most appropriate model to use for any speciﬁc causal analysis, improving on both power and false discovery rates. Using the approach, we systematically estimated the causal eﬀects amongst 2407 phenotypes. Almost 90\% of causal estimates indicated some level of horizontal pleiotropy. The causal estimates are organised into a publicly available graph database (http://eve.mrbase.org), and we use it here to highlight the numerous challenges that remain in automated causal inference.},

Both rely on faithfulness to infer that the latter only influences the target effect via the cause variable. In reality, it is likely that this assumption only holds approximately and that there will be at least some form of weak interaction. This brings about the paradoxical situation that, in the large-sample limit, no predictions are made, as detecting the weak edge invalidates the setting.  We introduce an alternative approach by replacing strict faithfulness with a prior that reflects the existence of many ’weak’ (irrelevant) and ’strong’ interactions. We obtain a posterior distribution over the target causal effect estimator which shows that, in many cases, we can still make good estimates. We demonstrate the approach in an application on a simple linear-Gaussian setting, using the MultiNest sampling algorithm, and compare it with established techniques to show our method is robust even when strict faithfulness is violated.}

	abstract = {In observational cohort mortality studies with prolonged periods of exposure to the agent under study, it is not uncommon for risk factors for death to be determinants of subsequent exposure. For instance, in occupational mortality studies date of termination of employment is both a determinant of future exposure (since terminated individuals receive no further exposure) and an independent risk factor for death (since disabled individuals tend to leave empioyment). When current risk factor status determines subsequent exposure and is determined by previous exposure, standard analyses that estimate age-specific mortality rates as a function of cumulative exposure may underestimate the true effect of exposure on mortality whether or not one adjusts for the risk factor in the analysis. This observation raises the question, which if any population parameters can be given a causal interpretation in observational mortality studies? In answer, we offer a graphical approach to the identification and computation of causal parameters in mortality studies with sustained exposure periods. This approach is shown to be equivalent to an approach in which the observational study is identified with a hypothetical double-blind randomized trial in which data on each subject’s assigned treatment protocol has been erased from the data tile. Causal inferences can then be made by comparing mortality as a function of treatment protocol, since, in a double-blind randomized trial missing data on treatment protocol, the association of mortality with treatment protocol can still be estimated.},

	abstract = {Mendelian randomisation analyses use genetic variants as instrumental variables ({IVs}) to estimate causal effects of modifiable risk factors on disease outcomes. Genetic variants typically explain a small proportion of the variability in risk factors; hence Mendelian randomisation analyses can require large sample sizes. However, an increasing number of genetic variants have been found to be robustly associated with disease-related outcomes in genome-wide association studies. Use of multiple instruments can improve the precision of {IV} estimates, and also permit examination of underlying {IV} assumptions. We discuss the use of multiple genetic variants in Mendelian randomisation analyses with continuous outcome variables where all relationships are assumed to be linear. We describe possible violations of {IV} assumptions, and how multiple instrument analyses can be used to identify them. We present an example using four adiposity-associated genetic variants as {IVs} for the causal effect of fat mass on bone density, using data on 5509 children enrolled in the {ALSPAC} birth cohort study. We also use simulation studies to examine the effect of different sets of {IVs} on precision and bias. When each instrument independently explains variability in the risk factor, use of multiple instruments increases the precision of {IV} estimates. However, inclusion of weak instruments could increase finite sample bias. Missing data on multiple genetic variants can diminish the available sample size, compared with single instrument analyses. In simulations with additive genotype-risk factor effects, {IV} estimates using a weighted allele score had similar properties to estimates using multiple instruments. Under the correct conditions, multiple instrument analyses are a promising approach for Mendelian randomisation studies. Further research is required into multiple imputation methods to address missing data issues in {IV} estimation.},

It has gained in popularity over the past decade with the use of genetic variants as instrumental variables, known as Mendelian randomization. An instrumental variable is associated with the exposure, but not associated with any confounder of the exposure–outcome association, nor is there any causal pathway from the instrumental variable to the outcome other than via the exposure. Under the assumption that a single instrumental variable or a set of instrumental variables for the exposure is available, the causal effect of the exposure on the outcome can be estimated. There are several methods available for instrumental variable estimation; we consider the ratio method, two-stage methods, likelihood-based methods, and semi-parametric methods. Techniques for obtaining statistical inferences and confidence intervals are presented. The statistical properties of estimates from these methods are compared, and practical advice is given about choosing a suitable analysis method. In particular, bias and coverage properties of estimators are considered, especially with weak instruments.

            Modern high-throughput experiments provide a rich resource to investigate causal determinants of disease risk. Mendelian randomization ({MR}) is the use of genetic variants as instrumental variables to infer the causal effect of a specific risk factor on an outcome. Multivariable {MR} is an extension of the standard {MR} framework to consider multiple potential risk factors in a single model. However, current implementations of multivariable {MR} use standard linear regression and hence perform poorly with many risk factors. Here, we propose a two-sample multivariable {MR} approach based on Bayesian model averaging ({MR}-{BMA}) that scales to high-throughput experiments. In a realistic simulation study, we show that {MR}-{BMA} can detect true causal risk factors even when the candidate risk factors are highly correlated. We illustrate {MR}-{BMA} by analysing publicly-available summarized data on metabolites to prioritise likely causal biomarkers for age-related macular degeneration.},

              Motivation
              The overall association evidence of a genetic variant with multiple traits can be evaluated by cross-phenotype association analysis using summary statistics from genome-wide association studies. Further dissecting the association pathways from a variant to multiple traits is important to understand the biological causal relationships among complex traits.
            
            
              Results
              Here, we introduce a flexible and computationally efficient Iterative Mendelian Randomization and Pleiotropy ({IMRP}) approach to simultaneously search for horizontal pleiotropic variants and estimate causal effect. Extensive simulations and real data applications suggest that {IMRP} has similar or better performance than existing Mendelian Randomization methods for both causal effect estimation and pleiotropic variant detection. The developed pleiotropy test is further extended to detect colocalization for multiple variants at a locus. {IMRP} will greatly facilitate our understanding of causal relationships underlying complex traits, in particular, when a large number of genetic instrumental variables are used for evaluating multiple traits.

            The proliferation of genome-wide association studies ({GWAS}) has prompted the use of two-sample Mendelian randomization ({MR}) with genetic variants as instrumental variables ({IVs}) for drawing reliable causal relationships between health risk factors and disease outcomes. However, the unique features of {GWAS} demand that {MR} methods account for both linkage disequilibrium ({LD}) and ubiquitously existing horizontal pleiotropy among complex traits, which is the phenomenon wherein a variant affects the outcome through mechanisms other than exclusively through the exposure. Therefore, statistical methods that fail to consider {LD} and horizontal pleiotropy can lead to biased estimates and false-positive causal relationships. To overcome these limitations, we proposed a probabilistic model for {MR} analysis in identifying the causal effects between risk factors and disease outcomes using {GWAS} summary statistics in the presence of {LD} and to properly account for horizontal pleiotropy among genetic variants ({MR}-{LDP}) and develop a computationally efficient algorithm to make the causal inference. We then conducted comprehensive simulation studies to demonstrate the advantages of {MR}-{LDP} over the existing methods. Moreover, we used two real exposure–outcome pairs to validate the results from {MR}-{LDP} compared with alternative methods, showing that our method is more efficient in using all-instrumental variants in {LD}. By further applying {MR}-{LDP} to lipid traits and body mass index ({BMI}) as risk factors for complex diseases, we identified multiple pairs of significant causal relationships, including a protective effect of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol on peripheral vascular disease and a positive causal effect of {BMI} on hemorrhoids.},

This posterior can be sampled via Markov chain Monte Carlo methods of inference to obtain point and interval estimates. The model priors require a minimal input from the user. We explore the performance of our method by means of a simulation experiment. Our results show that the method is reasonably robust to the presence of directional pleiotropy and moderate correlation between the instruments.

We describe an approach that aggregates phenotypes on the basis of patterns described by Mendelian diseases. We mapped the clinical features of 1204 Mendelian diseases into phenotypes captured from the electronic health record ({EHR}) and summarized this evidence as phenotype risk scores ({PheRSs}). In an initial validation, {PheRS} distinguished cases and controls of five Mendelian diseases. Applying {PheRS} to 21,701 genotyped individuals uncovered 18 associations between rare variants and phenotypes consistent with Mendelian diseases. In 16 patients, the rare genetic variants were associated with severe outcomes such as organ transplants. {PheRS} can augment rare-variant interpretation and may identify subsets of patients with distinct genetic causes for common diseases.},

	abstract = {We report genome sequences of 17 inbred strains of laboratory mice and identify almost ten times more variants than previously known. We use these genomes to explore the phylogenetic history of the laboratory mouse and to examine the functional consequences of allele-specific variation on transcript abundance, revealing that at least 12\% of transcripts show a significant tissue-specific expression bias. By identifying candidate functional variants at 718 quantitative trait loci we show that the molecular nature of functional variants and their position relative to genes vary according to the effect size of the locus. These sequences provide a starting point for a new era in the functional analysis of a key model organism. Until the end of the 20th century the molecular basis for mor-phological, physiological, biochemical and behavioural variation in laboratory mice remained largely obscure 1–3 . At the beginning of the 21st century, decoding the complete genome of one strain, C57BL/6J, the mouse reference genome, revolutionized our ability to relate sequence to function 4,5 . It enabled genetic screens in mice to be per-formed on an unprecedented scale 6 , it facilitated the task of creating a complete set of null alleles for all genes 7,8 , and it accelerated the dis-covery of mouse sequence diversity 9,10 . Our catalogues, however, remain incomplete and some forms of variation are largely undocumented. Whereas we now know more about the extent of phenotypic variation among laboratory strains of mice 11–16 and the complexity of genetic action, from fully penetrant Mendelian effects, partially penetrant modifiers 17,18 and non-additive effects 18 , to the quasi-infinitesimal genetic architecture that underlies most quantitative traits 19 , we are still largely ignorant of the molecular basis of the majority of genetically influenced phenotypes.

	abstract = {Making predictions about the next 100 years of genetics research is bound to be imprecise and biased, but I am going to stick my neck out anyway and make some shorter-term predictions, some no doubt controversial, about research and likely discoveries in human complex trait genetics. I moved into the field of human complex trait genetics less than 20 years ago, from a background in quantitative ge-netics and animal breeding. Even in this period of time, major changes have occurred that were hard to predict back in the 1990s. Driven by enormous advances in {DNA} sequencing technologies, one can now sequence and analyze an entire human genome for a few thousand dollars. Some may argue that the cost of a sequenced genome is much lower than that, but that usually ignores the expense of storage, analysis, and interpretation. Sequencing technology has facilitated easy and fast discovery of Mendelian disease mutations and coding variants with high penetrance (a high probability of disease given genotype), and has led to precise estimates of the per-generation mutation rate (1000 Genomes Project Consortium et al. 2010). In the same period, development of array geno-typing technology has made it possible to genotype hundreds of thousands of {DNA} variants for less than \$100. Millions of samples have been genotyped using such arrays to study the genetic basis of complex traits such as common disease and quantitative traits, which has led to the discovery of many thousands of genes, gene variants, and biological pathways that are associated with one or more complex traits (Visscher et al. 2012). The traits vary widely, from psychiatric disorders to autoimmune disease, cancer, anthropometric traits such as height and weight, traits measured in blood such as platelet size and counts, and behavioral traits such as intelligence and years of schooling. In addition to trait-variant discovery, the technologies have led to new discoveries in human evolution and population genetics. These mostly unpredicted rapid developments were not just taking place in human complex trait genetics. In plant and animal breeding, a revolution has been taking place in the last 15 years. In 2001, a theoretical paper in this journal showed that with a sufficiently dense marker map, linkage disequi-librium could be exploited to predict breeding values and speed up genetic gain by radically changing the structure of breeding programs (Meuwissen et al. 2001). This paper was published well before the first commercial {SNP} chips were available, and within 10 years of publication, the method, called " genomic selection " (or " genomic prediction "), was implemented in dairy cattle breeding programs around the world; breeders of other livestock species and crops are following the same route. The update of this technology has led to a doubling of the rate of genetic gain in dairy cattle (Veerkamp 2015), an astounding increase and an incredibly rapid up-date of new technology. My main thesis is that the relentless pace of technological innovation will cause a change in how science is conducted. Instead of the model-based hypothesis-testing science that dom-inated the last century, the next will be hypothesis-generating-discovery science that is driven by data. I believe that this change will not be confined to human complex trait genetics, but will apply to all areas of research in genetics. Genomics will become synonymous with biology, a trend already occurring.},

In particular, the limitations of observational epidemiological study including confounding, reverse causation and measurement error can afflict conventional mediation approaches and may lead to incorrect conclusions regarding causal effects. Solutions to analysing mediation which overcome these problems include the use of instrumental variable methods such as Mendelian randomization, which may be applied to evaluate causality in increasingly complex networks of omics data.},

Formulae have been published previously for the variance of actual relationship for a number of specific types of relatives but no general formula for non-inbred individuals is available. We provide here a unified framework that enables the variances for distant relatives to be easily computed, showing, for example, how the variance of sharing for great grandparent-great grandchild, great uncle-great nephew, half uncle-nephew and first cousins differ, even though they have the same expected relationship. Results are extended in order to include differences in map length between sexes, no recombination in males and sex linkage. We derive the magnitude of skew in the proportion shared, showing the skew becomes increasingly large the more distant the relationship. The results obtained for variation in actual relationship apply directly to the variation in actual inbreeding as both are functions of genomic coancestry, and we show how to partition the variation in actual inbreeding between and within families. Although the variance of actual relationship falls as individuals become more distant, its coefficient of variation rises, and so, exacerbated by the skewness, it becomes increasingly difficult to distinguish different pedigree relationships from the actual fraction of the genome shared.},

	abstract = {Mendelian randomization ({MR}) is a popular method in genetic epidemiology to estimate the eﬀect of an exposure on an outcome by using genetic instruments. These instruments are often selected from a combination of prior knowledge from genome wide association studies ({GWAS}) and data-driven instrument selection procedures or tests. Unfortunately, when testing for the exposure eﬀect, the instrument selection process done a priori is not accounted for. This paper studies and highlights the bias resulting from not accounting for the instrument selection process by focusing on a recent data-driven instrument selection procedure, {sisVIVE}, as an example. We introduce a conditional inference approach that conditions on the instrument selection done a priori and leverage recent advances in selective inference to derive conditional null distributions of popular test statistics for the exposure eﬀect in {MR}. The null distributions can be characterized with individual-level or summary-level data in {MR}. We show that our conditional conﬁdence intervals derived from conditional null distributions attain the desired nominal level while typical conﬁdence intervals computed in {MR} do not. We conclude by reanalyzing the eﬀect of {BMI} on diastolic blood pressure using summary-level data from the {UKBiobank} that accounts for instrument selection.},

Existing {TWAS} methods are primarily univariate in nature, focusing on analyzing one outcome trait at a time. However, many complex traits are correlated with each other and share a common genetic basis. Consequently, analyzing multiple traits jointly through multivariate analysis can potentially improve the power of {TWASs}. Here, we develop a method, {moPMR}-Egger (multiple outcome probabilistic Mendelian randomization with Egger assumption), for analyzing multiple outcome traits in {TWAS} applications. {moPMR}-Egger examines one gene at a time, relies on its cis-{SNPs} that are in potential linkage disequilibrium with each other to serve as instrumental variables, and tests its causal effects on multiple traits jointly. A key feature of {moPMR}-Egger is its ability to test and control for potential horizontal pleiotropic effects from instruments, thus maximizing power while minimizing false associations for {TWASs}. In simulations, {moPMR}-Egger provides calibrated type I error control for both causal effects testing and horizontal pleiotropic effects testing and is more powerful than existing univariate {TWAS} approaches in detecting causal associations. We apply {moPMR}-Egger to analyze 11 traits from 5 trait categories in the {UK} Biobank. In the analysis, {moPMR}-Egger identiﬁed 13.15\% more gene associations than univariate approaches across trait categories and revealed distinct regulatory mechanisms underlying systolic and diastolic blood pressures.},

	abstract = {Mediation analysis seeks to explain the pathway(s) through which an exposure affects an outcome. Mediation analysis experiences a number of methodological difficulties, including bias due to confounding and measurement error. Mendelian randomisation ({MR}) can be used to improve causal inference for mediation analysis. We describe two approaches that can be used for estimating mediation analysis with {MR}: multivariable Mendelian randomisation ({MVMR}) and two-step Mendelian randomisation. We outline the approaches and provide code to demonstrate how they can be used in mediation analysis. We review issues that can affect analyses, including confounding, measurement error, weak instrument bias, and analysis of multiple mediators. Description of the methods is supplemented by simulated and real data examples. Although Mendelian randomisation relies on large sample sizes and strong assumptions, such as having strong instruments and no horizontally pleiotropic pathways, our examples demonstrate that it is unlikely to be affected by confounders of the exposure or mediator and the outcome, reverse causality and non-differential measurement error of the exposure or mediator. Both {MVMR} and two-step {MR} can be implemented in both individual-level {MR} and summary data {MR}, and can improve causal inference in mediation analysis.},

	abstract = {Mendelian randomization ({MR}) is a common analytic tool for exploring the causal relationship among complex traits. Existing {MR} methods require selecting a small set of single nucleotide polymorphisms ({SNPs}) to serve as instrument variables. However, selecting a small set of {SNPs} may not be ideal, as most complex traits have a polygenic or omnigenic architecture and are each inf luenced by thousands of {SNPs}. Here, motivated by the recent omnigenic hypothesis, we present an {MR} method that uses all genome-wide {SNPs} for causal inference. Our method uses summary statistics from genome-wide association studies as input, accommodates the commonly encountered horizontal pleiotropy effects and relies on a composite likelihood framework for scalable computation. We refer to our method as the omnigenic Mendelian randomization, or {OMR}. We examine the power and robustness of {OMR} through extensive simulations including those under various modeling misspecifications. We apply {OMR} to several real data applications, where we identify multiple complex traits that potentially causally inf luence coronary artery disease ({CAD}) and asthma. The identified new associations reveal important roles of blood lipids, blood pressure and immunity underlying {CAD} as well as important roles of immunity and obesity underlying asthma.},

Several scenarios violating the Mendelian randomization assumptions are described, including settings with inadequate phenotype definition, the setting of time-varying exposures, the presence of gene–environment interaction, the existence of measurement error, the possibility of reverse causation, and the presence of linkage disequilibrium. Data analysis examples are given, illustrating that the inappropriate use of instrumental variable techniques when the Mendelian randomization assumptions are violated can lead to biases of enormous magnitude. To help address some of the strong assumptions being made, three possible approaches are suggested. First, the original proposal of Katan (Lancet. 1986;1:507–508) for Mendelian randomization was not to use instrumental variable techniques to obtain estimates but merely to examine genotype–outcome associations to test for the presence of an effect of the exposure on the outcome. We show that this more modest goal and approach can circumvent many, though not all, the potential biases described. Second, we discuss the use of sensitivity analysis in evaluating the consequences of violations in the assumptions and in attempting to correct for those violations. Third, we suggest that a focus on negative, rather than positive, Mendelian randomization results may turn out to be more reliable.},

	abstract = {Valid estimation of a causal effect using instrumental variables requires that all of the instruments are independent of the outcome conditional on the risk factor of interest and any confounders. In Mendelian randomization studies with large numbers of genetic variants used as instruments, it is unlikely that this condition will be met. Any given genetic variant could be associated with a large number of traits, all of which represent potential pathways to the outcome which bypass the risk factor of interest. Such pleiotropy can be accounted for using standard multivariable Mendelian randomization with all possible pleiotropic traits included as covariates. However, the estimator obtained in this way will be inefﬁcient if some of the covariates do not truly sit on pleiotropic pathways to the outcome. We present a method that uses regularization to identify which out of a set of potential covariates need to be accounted for in a Mendelian randomization analysis in order to produce an efﬁcient and robust estimator of a causal effect. The method can be used in the case where individual-level data are not available and the analysis must rely on summary-level data only. It can be used where there are any number of potential pleiotropic covariates up to the number of genetic variants less one. We show the results of simulation studies that demonstrate the performance of the proposed regularization method in realistic settings. We also illustrate the method in an applied example which looks at the causal effect of urate plasma concentration on coronary heart disease.},

However, the nature of genetic variants is such that pleiotropy remains a barrier to valid causal effect estimation. There are many options in the literature for pleiotropy robust methods when studying the effects of a single risk factor on an outcome. However, there are few pleiotropy robust methods in the multivariable setting, that is, when there are multiple risk factors of interest. In this article we introduce three methods which build on common approaches in the univariable setting: {MVMR}-Robust; {MVMR}-Median; and {MVMR}-Lasso. We discuss the properties of each of these methods and examine their performance in comparison to existing approaches in a simulation study. {MVMR}-Robust is shown to outperform existing outlier robust approaches when there are low levels of pleiotropy. {MVMR}-Lasso provides the best estimation in terms of mean squared error for moderate to high levels of pleiotropy, and can provide valid inference in a three sample setting. {MVMR}-Median performs well in terms of estimation across all scenarios considered, and provides valid inference up to a moderate level of pleiotropy. We demonstrate the methods in an applied example looking at the effects of intelligence, education and household income on the risk of Alzheimer’s disease.},

	abstract = {Modern population-scale biobanks contain simultaneous measurements of many phenotypes, providing unprecedented opportunity to study the relationship between biomarkers and disease. However, inferring causal effects from observational data is notoriously challenging. Mendelian randomization ({MR}) has recently received increased attention as a class of methods for estimating causal effects using genetic associations. However, standard methods result in pervasive false positives when two traits share a heritable, unobserved common cause. This is the problem of correlated pleiotropy. Here, we introduce a ﬂexible framework for simulating traits with a common genetic confounder that generalizes recently proposed models, as well as a simple approach we call Welch-weighted Egger regression ({WWER}) for estimating causal effects. We show in comprehensive simulations that our method substantially reduces false positives due to correlated pleiotropy while being fast enough to apply to hundreds of phenotypes. We apply our method ﬁrst to a subset of the {UK} Biobank consisting of blood traits and inﬂammatory disease, and then to a broader set of 411 heritable phenotypes. We detect many effects with strong literature support, as well as numerous behavioral effects that appear to stem from physician advice given to people at high risk for disease. We conclude that {WWER} is a powerful tool for exploratory data analysis in ever-growing databases of genotypes and phenotypes.},

	abstract = {Background: Associations between type 2 diabetes (T2D) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ({ALS}) were discovered in observational studies in both European and East Asian populations. However, whether such associations are causal remains largely unknown.
Methods: We employed a two-sample Mendelian randomization approach to evaluate the causal relationship of T2D with the risk of {ALS} in both European and East Asian populations. Our analysis was implemented using summary statistics obtained from large-scale genome-wide association studies with {\textasciitilde}660,000 individuals for T2D and {\textasciitilde}81,000 individuals for {ALS} in the European population, and {\textasciitilde}191,000 individuals for T2D and {\textasciitilde}4100 individuals for {ALS} in the East Asian population. The causal relationship between T2D and {ALS} in both populations was estimated using the inverse-variance-weighted methods and was further validated through extensive complementary and sensitivity analyses.
Results: Using multiple instruments that were strongly associated with T2D, a negative association between T2D and {ALS} was identified in the European population with the odds ratio ({OR}) estimated to be 0.93 (95\% {CI} 0.88–0.99, p = 0.023), while a positive association between T2D and {ALS} was observed in the East Asian population with {OR} = 1.28 (95\% {CI} 0.99–1.62, p = 0.058). These results were robust against instrument selection, various modeling misspecifications, and estimation biases, with the Egger regression and {MR}-{PRESSO} ruling out the possibility of horizontal pleiotropic effects of instruments. However, no causal association was found between T2Drelated exposures (including glycemic traits) and {ALS} in the European population.
Conclusion: Our results provide new evidence supporting the causal neuroprotective role of T2D on {ALS} in the European population and provide empirically suggestive evidence of increasing risk of T2D on {ALS} in the East Asian population. Our results have an important implication on {ALS} pathology, paving ways for developing therapeutic strategies across multiple populations.},

	abstract = {Mendelian randomization investigations are becoming more powerful and simpler to perform, due to the increasing size and coverage of genome-wide association studies and the increasing availability of summarized data on genetic associations with risk factors and disease outcomes. However, when using multiple genetic variants from different gene regions in a Mendelian randomization analysis, it is highly implausible that all the genetic variants satisfy the instrumental variable assumptions. This means that a simple instrumental variable analysis alone should not be relied on to give a causal conclusion. In this article, we discuss a range of sensitivity analyses that will either support or question the validity of causal inference from a Mendelian randomization analysis with multiple genetic variants. We focus on sensitivity analyses of greatest practical relevance for ensuring robust causal inferences, and those that can be undertaken using summarized data. Aside from cases in which the justification of the instrumental variable assumptions is supported by strong biological understanding, a Mendelian randomization analysis in which no assessment of the robustness of the findings to violations of the instrumental variable assumptions has been made should be viewed as speculative and incomplete. In particular, Mendelian randomization investigations with large numbers of genetic variants without such sensitivity analyses should be treated with skepticism.},

However, {MR} inference requires three assumptions, one of which is that the genetic variants only influence the outcome through phenotype of interest. Pleiotropy, that is, the situation in which some genetic variants affect more than one phenotype, can invalidate these genetic variants for use as instrumental variables; thus a naive analysis will give biased estimates of the causal relation. Here, we present new methods (constrained instrumental variable [{CIV}] methods) to construct valid instrumental variables and perform adjusted causal effect estimation when pleiotropy exists and when the pleiotropic phenotypes are available. We demonstrate that a smoothed version of {CIV} performs approximate selection of genetic variants that are valid instruments, and provides unbiased estimates of the causal effects. We provide details on a number of existing methods, together with a comparison of their performance in a large series of simulations. {CIV} performs robustly across different pleiotropic violations of the {MR} assumptions.

This scenario is likely to occur when there are several distinct causal mechanisms by which a risk factor inﬂuences an outcome with different magnitudes of causal effect. We have developed an algorithm {MR}-Clust that ﬁnds such clusters of variants, and so can identify variants that reﬂect distinct causal mechanisms.

            Mendelian randomization ({MR}) is an epidemiological technique that uses genetic variants to distinguish correlation from causation in observational data. The reliability of a {MR} investigation depends on the validity of the genetic variants as instrumental variables ({IVs}). We develop the contamination mixture method, a method for {MR} with two modalities. First, it identifies groups of genetic variants with similar causal estimates, which may represent distinct mechanisms by which the risk factor influences the outcome. Second, it performs {MR} robustly and efficiently in the presence of invalid {IVs}. Compared to other robust methods, it has the lowest mean squared error across a range of realistic scenarios. The method identifies 11 variants associated with increased high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, decreased triglyceride levels, and decreased coronary heart disease risk that have the same directions of associations with various blood cell traits, suggesting a shared mechanism linking lipids and coronary heart disease risk mediated via platelet aggregation.},

We demonstrate how such coefﬁcients from multiple variants can be combined in a Mendelian randomization analysis to estimate the causal effect of a risk factor on an outcome. The bias and efﬁciency of estimates based on summarized data are compared to those based on individual-level data in simulation studies. We investigate the impact of gene–gene interactions, linkage disequilibrium, and ‘weak instruments’ on these estimates. Both an inverse-variance weighted average of variantspeciﬁc associations and a likelihood-based approach for summarized data give similar estimates and precision to the two-stage least squares method for individual-level data, even when there are gene–gene interactions. However, these summarized data methods overstate precision when variants are in linkage disequilibrium. If the P-value in a linear regression of the risk factor for each variant is less than 1 × 10−5, then weak instrument bias will be small. We use these methods to estimate the causal association of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ({LDL}-C) on coronary artery disease using published data on ﬁve genetic variants. A 30\% reduction in {LDL}-C is estimated to reduce coronary artery disease risk by 67\% (95\% {CI}: 54\% to 76\%). We conclude that Mendelian randomization investigations using summarized data from uncorrelated variants are similarly efﬁcient to those using individual-level data, although the necessary assumptions cannot be so fully assessed.},

However, genetic instruments remain controversial, as horizontal pleiotropic effects can introduce bias into causal estimates. Recent work has highlighted the potential of gene–environment interactions in detecting and correcting for pleiotropic bias in {MR} analyses.
Methods: We introduce {MR} using Gene-by-Environment interactions ({MRGxE}) as a framework capable of identifying and correcting for pleiotropic bias. If an instrument–covariate interaction induces variation in the association between a genetic instrument and exposure, it is possible to identify and correct for pleiotropic effects. The interpretation of {MRGxE} is similar to conventional summary {MR} approaches, with a particular advantage of {MRGxE} being the ability to assess the validity of an individual instrument.
Results: We investigate the effect of adiposity, measured using body mass index ({BMI}), upon systolic blood pressure ({SBP}) using data from the {UK} Biobank and a single weighted allelic score informed by data from the {GIANT} consortium. We ﬁnd {MRGxE} produces ﬁndings in agreement with two-sample summary {MR} approaches. Further, we perform simulations highlighting the utility of the approach even when the {MRGxE} assumptions are violated.
Conclusions: By utilizing instrument–covariate interactions in {MR} analyses implemented within a linear-regression framework, it is possible to identify and correct for horizontal pleiotropic bias, provided the average magnitude of pleiotropy is constant across interaction-covariate subgroups.},

              Background
              Two-sample summary-data Mendelian randomization ({MR}) incorporating multiple genetic variants within a meta-analysis framework is a popular technique for assessing causality in epidemiology. If all genetic variants satisfy the instrumental variable ({IV}) and necessary modelling assumptions, then their individual ratio estimates of causal effect should be homogeneous. Observed heterogeneity signals that one or more of these assumptions could have been violated.
            
            
              Methods
              Causal estimation and heterogeneity assessment in {MR} require an approximation for the variance, or equivalently the inverse-variance weight, of each ratio estimate. We show that the most popular ‘first-order’ weights can lead to an inflation in the chances of detecting heterogeneity when in fact it is not present. Conversely, ostensibly more accurate ‘second-order’ weights can dramatically increase the chances of failing to detect heterogeneity when it is truly present. We derive modified weights to mitigate both of these adverse effects.
            
            
              Results
              Using Monte Carlo simulations, we show that the modified weights outperform first- and second-order weights in terms of heterogeneity quantification. Modified weights are also shown to remove the phenomenon of regression dilution bias in {MR} estimates obtained from weak instruments, unlike those obtained using first- and second-order weights. However, with small numbers of weak instruments, this comes at the cost of a reduction in estimate precision and power to detect a causal effect compared with first-order weighting. Moreover, first-order weights always furnish unbiased estimates and preserve the type I error rate under the causal null. We illustrate the utility of the new method using data from a recent two-sample summary-data {MR} analysis to assess the causal role of systolic blood pressure on coronary heart disease risk.
            
            
              Conclusions
              We propose the use of modified weights within two-sample summary-data {MR} studies for accurately quantifying heterogeneity and detecting outliers in the presence of weak instruments. Modified weights also have an important role to play in terms of causal estimation (in tandem with first-order weights) but further research is required to understand their strengths and weaknesses in specific settings.},

However, obtaining reliable results from a Mendelian randomization investigation remains problematic, as the conventional inverse-variance weighted method only gives consistent estimates if all of the genetic variants in the analysis are valid instrumental variables. We present a novel weighted median estimator for combining data on multiple genetic variants into a single causal estimate. This estimator is consistent even when up to 50\% of the information comes from invalid instrumental variables. In a simulation analysis, it is shown to have better ﬁnite-sample Type 1 error rates than the inverse-variance weighted method, and is complementary to the recently proposed {MR}-Egger (Mendelian randomization-Egger) regression method. In analyses of the causal effects of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol on coronary artery disease risk, the inverse-variance weighted method suggests a causal effect of both lipid fractions, whereas the weighted median and {MR}-Egger regression methods suggest a null effect of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol that corresponds with the experimental evidence. Both median-based and {MR}-Egger regression methods should be considered as sensitivity analyses for Mendelian randomization investigations with multiple genetic variants.},

	abstract = {Background: The number of Mendelian randomization analyses including large numbers of genetic variants is rapidly increasing. This is due to the proliferation of genome-wide association studies, and the desire to obtain more precise estimates of causal effects. However, some genetic variants may not be valid instrumental variables, in particular due to them having more than one proximal phenotypic correlate (pleiotropy).
Methods: We view Mendelian randomization with multiple instruments as a meta-analysis, and show that bias caused by pleiotropy can be regarded as analogous to small study bias. Causal estimates using each instrument can be displayed visually by a funnel plot to assess potential asymmetry. Egger regression, a tool to detect small study bias in meta-analysis, can be adapted to test for bias from pleiotropy, and the slope coefﬁcient from Egger regression provides an estimate of the causal effect. Under the assumption that the association of each genetic variant with the exposure is independent of the pleiotropic effect of the variant (not via the exposure), Egger’s test gives a valid test of the null causal hypothesis and a consistent causal effect estimate even when all the genetic variants are invalid instrumental variables.
Results: We illustrate the use of this approach by re-analysing two published Mendelian randomization studies of the causal effect of height on lung function, and the causal effect of blood pressure on coronary artery disease risk. The conservative nature of this approach is illustrated with these examples.
Conclusions: An adaption of Egger regression (which we call {MR}-Egger) can detect some violations of the standard instrumental variable assumptions, and provide an effect estimate which is not subject to these violations. The approach provides a sensitivity analysis for the robustness of the ﬁndings from a Mendelian randomization investigation.},

The adjustment is applied to the profile loglikelihood score function at each parameter value so that its mean is zero and its variance is the negative expected derivative matrix of the adjusted score function. For cases in which explicit calculation of the adjustments is difficult, we give two methods to simplify their computation: an 'automatic' simulation method that requires as input only the profile loglikelihood and its first few derivatives; first-order asymptotic expressions. Some examples are provided and a comparison is made with the conditional profile log-likelihood of Cox and Reid.},

	abstract = {Pleiotropy, the phenomenon of a single genetic variant inﬂuencing multiple traits, is likely widespread in the human genome. If pleiotropy arises because the single nucleotide polymorphism ({SNP}) inﬂuences one trait, which in turn inﬂuences another (‘vertical pleiotropy’), then Mendelian randomization ({MR}) can be used to estimate the causal inﬂuence between the traits. Of prime focus among the many limitations to {MR} is the unprovable assumption that apparent pleiotropic associations are mediated by the exposure (i.e. reﬂect vertical pleiotropy), and do not arise due to {SNPs} inﬂuencing the two traits through independent pathways (‘horizontal pleiotropy’). The burgeoning treasure trove of genetic associations yielded through genome wide association studies makes for a tantalizing prospect of phenome-wide causal inference. Recent years have seen substantial attention devoted to the problem of horizontal pleiotropy, and in this review we outline how newly developed methods can be used together to improve the reliability of {MR}.},

However, some attention has to be paid to the details, as not all such methods target the same causal parameters and some rely on more restrictive parametric assumptions than others. We therefore discuss and contrast the most common {IV} approaches with relevance to typical applications in observational epidemiology. Further, we illustrate and compare the asymptotic bias of these {IV} estimators when underlying assumptions are violated in a numerical study. One of our conclusions is that all {IV} methods encounter problems in the presence of effect modiﬁcation by unobserved confounders. Since this can never be ruled out for sure, we recommend that practical applications of {IV} estimators be accompanied routinely by a sensitivity analysis.},

Unfortunately, instruments in {MR} studies are often weakly associated with the exposure, which can bias effect estimates and inflate Type I errors. In this work, we propose test statistics that are robust under weak-instrument asymptotics by extending the Anderson–Rubin, Kleibergen, and the conditional likelihood ratio test in econometrics to two-sample summary-data {MR}. We also use the proposed Anderson–Rubin test to develop a point estimator and to detect invalid instruments. We conclude with a simulation and an empirical study and show that the proposed tests control size and have better power than existing methods with weak instruments.},

The statistic has a 2 limiting distribution with a degrees of freedom parameter equal to the number of structural parameters. The limiting distribution does not depend on nuisance parameters. The statistic overcomes the deﬁciencies of the Anderson-Rubin statistic, whose limiting distribution has a degrees of freedom parameter equal to the number of instruments, and the likelihood based, Wald, likelihood ratio, and Lagrange multiplier statistics, whose limiting distributions depend on nuisance parameters. Size and power comparisons reveal that the statistic is a (asymptotic) size-corrected likelihood ratio statistic.

	abstract = {Background Mendelian randomization uses a carefully selected gene as an instrumental-variable ({IV}) to test or estimate an association between a phenotype and a disease. Classical {IV} analysis assumes linear relationships between the variables, but disease status is often binary and modelled by a logistic regression. When the linearity assumption between the variables does not hold the {IV} estimates will be biased. The extent of this bias in the phenotypedisease log odds ratio of a Mendelian randomization study is investigated.
Methods Three estimators termed direct, standard {IV} and adjusted {IV}, of the phenotype-disease log odds ratio are compared through a simulation study which incorporates unmeasured confounding. The simulations are verified using formulae relating marginal and conditional estimates given in the Appendix.
Results The simulations show that the direct estimator is biased by unmeasured confounding factors and the standard {IV} estimator is attenuated towards the null. Under most circumstances the adjusted {IV} estimator has the smallest bias, although it has inflated type I error when the unmeasured confounders have a large effect.
Conclusions In a Mendelian randomization study with a binary disease outcome the bias associated with estimating the phenotype-disease log odds ratio may be of practical importance and so estimates should be subject to a sensitivity analysis against different amounts of hypothesized confounding.},

Several high-proﬁle situations exist in which randomized controlled trials of precisely the same intervention that has been examined in observational studies have produced markedly different ﬁndings. In other observational sciences, the use of instrumental variable ({IV}) approaches has been one approach to strengthening causal inferences in non-experimental situations. The use of germline genetic variants that proxy for environmentally modiﬁable exposures as instruments for these exposures is one form of {IV} analysis that can be implemented within observational epidemiological studies. The method has been referred to as ‘Mendelian randomization’, and can be considered as analogous to randomized controlled trials. This paper outlines Mendelian randomization, draws parallels with {IV} methods, provides examples of implementation of the approach and discusses limitations of the approach and some methods for dealing with these.

	abstract = {In epidemiological research, the causal effect of a modifiable phenotype or exposure on a disease is often of public health interest. Randomized controlled trials to investigate this effect are not always possible and inferences based on observational data can be confounded. However, if we know of a gene closely linked to the phenotype without direct effect on the disease, it can often be reasonably assumed that the gene is not itself associated with any confounding factors — a phenomenon called Mendelian randomization. These properties define an instrumental variable and allow estimation of the causal effect, despite the confounding, under certain model restrictions. In this paper, we present a formal framework for causal inference based on Mendelian randomization and suggest using directed acyclic graphs to check model assumptions by visual inspection. This framework allows us to address limitations of the Mendelian randomization technique that have often been overlooked in the medical literature.},

There is a general lack of awareness that this eﬀect homogeneity assumption can be violated when there are multiple causal pathways involved, even if all the instrumental variables are valid. In this article, we introduce a latent mixture model {MR}-{PATH} that groups instruments that yield similar causal eﬀect estimates together. We develop a Monte-Carlo {EM} algorithm to ﬁt this mixture model, derive approximate conﬁdence intervals for uncertainty quantiﬁcation, and adopt a modiﬁed Bayesian Information Criterion ({BIC}) for model selection. We verify the eﬃcacy of the Monte-Carlo {EM} algorithm, conﬁdence intervals, and model selection criterion using numerical simulations. We identify potential mechanistic heterogeneity when applying our method to estimate the eﬀect of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol on coronary heart disease and the eﬀect of adiposity on type {II} diabetes.},

	abstract = {Mendelian randomization ({MR}) is a powerful instrumental variable ({IV}) method for estimating the causal effect of an exposure on an outcome of interest even in the presence of unmeasured confounding by using genetic variants as {IVs}. However, the correlated and idiosyncratic pleiotropy phenomena in the human genome will lead to biased estimation of causal effects if they are not properly accounted for. In this article, we develop a novel {MR} approach named {MRCIP} to account for correlated and idiosyncratic pleiotropy simultaneously. We first propose a random-effect model to explicitly model the correlated pleiotropy and then propose a novel weighting scheme to handle the presence of idiosyncratic pleiotropy. The model parameters are estimated by maximizing a weighted likelihood function with our proposed {PRW}-{EM} algorithm. Moreover, we can also estimate the degree of the correlated pleiotropy and perform a likelihood ratio test for its presence. Extensive simulation studies show that the proposed {MRCIP} has improved performance over competing methods. We also illustrate the usefulness of {MRCIP} on two real datasets. The R package for {MRCIP} is publicly available at https://githu b.com/siqixu/{MRCIP}.},

This means that a simple instrumental variable analysis alone should not be relied on to give a causal conclusion. In this article, we discuss a range of sensitivity analyses that will either support or question the validity of causal inference from a Mendelian randomization analysis with multiple genetic variants. We focus on sensitivity analyses of greatest practical relevance for ensuring robust causal inferences, and those that can be undertaken using summarized data. Aside from cases in which the justification of the instrumental variable assumptions is supported by strong biological understanding, a Mendelian randomization analysis in which no assessment of the robustness of the findings to violations of the instrumental variable assumptions has been made should be viewed as speculative and incomplete. In particular, Mendelian randomization investigations with large numbers of genetic variants without such sensitivity analyses should be treated with skepticism.},

            Mendelian randomization ({MR}) is a common tool for identifying causal risk factors underlying diseases. Here, we present a method, {MRAID}, for effective {MR} analysis. {MRAID} borrows ideas from fine mapping analysis to model an initial set of candidate {SNPs} that are in potentially high linkage disequilibrium with each other and automatically selects among them the suitable instruments for causal inference. {MRAID} also explicitly models both uncorrelated and correlated horizontal pleiotropic effects that are widespread for complex trait analysis. {MRAID} achieves both tasks through a joint likelihood framework and relies on a scalable sampling-based algorithm to compute calibrated

            Mendelian Randomisation ({MR}) is an increasingly popular approach that estimates the causal effect of risk factors on complex human traits. While it has seen several extensions that relax its basic assumptions, most suffer from two major limitations; their under-exploitation of genome-wide markers, and sensitivity to the presence of a heritable confounder of the exposure-outcome relationship. To overcome these limitations, we propose a Latent Heritable Confounder {MR} ({LHC}-{MR}) method applicable to association summary statistics, which estimates bi-directional causal effects, direct heritabilities, and confounder effects while accounting for sample overlap. We demonstrate that {LHC}-{MR} outperforms several existing {MR} methods in a wide range of simulation settings and apply it to summary statistics of 13 complex traits. Besides several concordant results with other {MR} methods, {LHC}-{MR} unravels new mechanisms (how disease diagnosis might lead to improved lifestyle) and reveals new causal effects (e.g. {HDL} cholesterol being protective against high systolic blood pressure), hidden from standard {MR} methods due to a heritable confounder of opposite effect direction.},

	abstract = {Background Mendelian Randomization ({MR}) studies assess the causality of an exposure–disease association using genetic determinants [i.e. instrumental variables ({IVs})] of the exposure. Power and {IV} strength requirements for {MR} studies using multiple genetic variants have not been explored.
Methods We simulated cohort data sets consisting of a normally distributed disease trait, a normally distributed exposure, which affects this trait and a biallelic genetic variant that affects the exposure. We estimated power to detect an effect of exposure on disease for varying allele frequencies, effect sizes and samples sizes (using two-stage least squares regression on 10 000 data sets—Stage 1 is a regression of exposure on the variant. Stage 2 is a regression of disease on the fitted exposure). Similar analyses were conducted using multiple genetic variants (5, 10, 20) as independent or combined {IVs}. We assessed {IV} strength using the first-stage F statistic.
Results Simulations of realistic scenarios indicate that {MR} studies will require large (n41000), often very large (n410 000), sample sizes. In many cases, so-called ‘weak {IV}’ problems arise when using multiple variants as independent {IVs} (even with as few as five), resulting in biased effect estimates. Combining genetic factors into fewer {IVs} results in modest power decreases, but alleviates weak {IV} problems. Ideal methods for combining genetic factors depend upon knowledge of the genetic architecture underlying the exposure.
Conclusions The feasibility of well-powered, unbiased {MR} studies will depend upon the amount of variance in the exposure that can be explained by known genetic factors and the ‘strength’ of the {IV} set derived from these genetic factors.},

We propose a new method that can often make {EM} much faster. The intuitive idea is to use a 'covariance adjustment' to correct the analysis of the M step, capitalising on extra information captured in the imputed complete data. The way we accomplish this is by parameter expansion; we expand the complete-data model while preserving the observed-data model and use the expanded complete-data model to generate {EM}. This parameter-expanded Ei M, {PX}-{EM}, algorithm shares the simplicity and stability of ordinary {EM}, but has a faster rate of convergence since its M step performs a more efficient analysis. The {PX}-{EM} algorithm is illustrated for the multivariate t distribution, a random effects model, factor analysis, probit regression and a Poisson imaging model.},

Recently, a collaborative mixed model ({CoMM}) was proposed to jointly interrogate genome on complex traits by integrating both the {GWAS} dataset and the expression quantitative trait loci ({eQTL}) dataset. Although {CoMM} is a powerful approach that leverages regulatory information while accounting for the uncertainty in using an {eQTL} dataset, it requires individual-level {GWAS} data and cannot fully make use of widely available {GWAS} summary statistics.

	abstract = {Background Mendelian randomization is used to test and estimate the magnitude of a causal effect of a phenotype on an outcome by using genetic variants as instrumental variables ({IVs}). Estimates of association from {IV} analysis are biased in the direction of the confounded, observational association between phenotype and outcome. The magnitude of the bias depends on the F-statistic for the strength of relationship between {IVs} and phenotype. We seek to develop guidelines for the design and analysis of Mendelian randomization studies to minimize bias.
Methods {IV} analysis was performed on simulated and real data to investigate the effect on bias of size of study, number and choice of instruments and method of analysis.
Results Bias is shown to increase as the expected F-statistic decreases, and can be reduced by using parsimonious models of genetic association (i.e. not over-parameterized) and by adjusting for measured covariates. Using data from a single study, the causal estimate of a unit increase in log-transformed C-reactive protein on fibrinogen (mmol/l) is shown to increase from À0.005 (P ¼ 0.99) to 0.792 (P ¼ 0.00003) due to injudicious choice of instrument. Moreover, when the observed F-statistic is larger than expected in a particular study, the causal estimate is more biased towards the observational association and its standard error is smaller. This correlation between causal estimate and standard error introduces a second source of bias into meta-analysis of Mendelian randomization studies. Bias can be alleviated in meta-analyses by using individual level data and by pooling genetic effects across studies.
Conclusions Weak instrument bias is of practical importance for the design and analysis of Mendelian randomization studies. Post hoc choice of instruments, genetic models or data based on measured F-statistics can exacerbate bias. In particular, the commonly cited rule of thumb that F410 avoids bias in {IV} analysis is misleading.},

	abstract = {Abstract
          
            Background
            Inverse-variance weighted two-sample Mendelian randomization ({IVW}-{MR}) is the most widely used approach that utilizes genome-wide association studies ({GWAS}) summary statistics to infer the existence and the strength of the causal effect between an exposure and an outcome. Estimates from this approach can be subject to different biases due to the use of weak instruments and winner’s curse, which can change as a function of the overlap between the exposure and outcome samples.
          
          
            Methods
            
              We developed a method (
              {MRlap}
              ) that simultaneously considers weak instrument bias and winner’s curse, while accounting for potential sample overlap. Assuming spike-and-slab genomic architecture and leveraging {LD}-score regression and other techniques, we could analytically derive, reliably estimate, and hence correct for the bias of {IVW}-{MR} using association summary statistics only.
            
          
          
            Results
            We tested our approach using simulated data for a wide range of realistic settings. In all the explored scenarios, our correction reduced the bias, in some situations by as much as 30 folds. When applied to real data on obesity-related exposures, we observed significant differences between {IVW}-based and corrected effects, both for non-overlapping and fully overlapping samples. Additionally, our results are consistent with the fact that the strength of the biases will decrease as the sample size increases. Finally, we also showed that the overall bias is also dependent on the genetic architecture of the exposure, and traits with low heritability and/or high polygenicity are more strongly affected.
          
          
            Conclusions
            Our method not only reduces bias in causal effect estimation but also enables the use of much larger {GWAS} sample sizes, by allowing for potentially overlapping samples.},

	abstract = {Mendelian randomization analyses are often performed using summarized data. The causal estimate from a one-sample analysis (in which data are taken from a single data source) with weak instrumental variables is biased in the direction of the observational association between the risk factor and outcome, whereas the estimate from a two-sample analysis (in which data on the risk factor and outcome are taken from non-overlapping datasets) is less biased and any bias is in the direction of the null. When using genetic consortia that have partially overlapping sets of participants, the direction and extent of bias are uncertain. In this paper, we perform simulation studies to investigate the magnitude of bias and Type 1 error rate inﬂation arising from sample overlap. We consider both a continuous outcome and a case-control setting with a binary outcome. For a continuous outcome, bias due to sample overlap is a linear function of the proportion of overlap between the samples. So, in the case of a null causal eﬀect, if the relative bias of the one-sample instrumental variable estimate is 10\% (corresponding to an F parameter of 10), then the relative bias with 50\% sample overlap is 5\%, and with 30\% sample overlap is 3\%. In a case-control setting, if risk factor measurements are only included for the control participants, unbiased estimates are obtained even in a one-sample setting. However, if risk factor data on both control and case participants are used, then bias is similar with a binary outcome as with a continuous outcome. Consortia releasing publicly available data on the associations of genetic variants with continuous risk factors should provide estimates that exclude case participants from case-control samples.},

	abstract = {Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ({ALS}) is a late-onset fatal neurodegenerative disorder that is predicted to increase across the globe by ∼70\% in the following decades. Understanding the disease causal mechanism underlying {ALS} and identifying modifiable risks factors for {ALS} hold the key for the development of effective preventative and treatment strategies. Here, we investigate the causal effects of four blood lipid traits that include high-density lipoprotein, low-density lipoprotein ({LDL}), total cholesterol and triglycerides on the risk of {ALS}. By leveraging instrument variables from multiple large-scale genome-wide association studies in both European and East Asian populations, we carry out one of the largest and most comprehensive Mendelian randomization analyses performed to date on the causal relationship between lipids and {ALS}. Among the four lipids, we found that only {LDL} is causally associated with {ALS} and that higher {LDL} level increases the risk of {ALS} in both the European and East Asian populations. Specifically, the odds ratio of {ALS} per 1 standard deviation (i.e. 39.0 mg/{dL}) increase of {LDL} is estimated to be 1.14 [95\% confidence interval ({CI}), 1.05–1.24; P = 1.38E-3] in the European population and 1.06 (95\% {CI}, 1.00–1.12; P = 0.044) in the East Asian population. The identified causal relationship between {LDL} and {ALS} is robust with respect to the choice of statistical methods and is validated through extensive sensitivity analyses that guard against various model assumption violations. Our study provides important evidence supporting the causal role of higher {LDL} on increasing the risk of {ALS}, paving ways for the development of preventative strategies for reducing the disease burden of {ALS} across multiple nations.},

	abstract = {In epidemiological research, the causal effect of a modifiable phenotype or exposure on a disease is often of public health interest. Randomized controlled trials to investigate this effect are not always possible and inferences based on observational data can be confounded. However, if we know of a gene closely linked to the phenotype without direct effect on the disease, it can often be reasonably assumed that the gene is not itself associated with any confounding factors — a phenomenon called Mendelian randomization. These properties define an instrumental variable and allow estimation of the causal effect, despite the confounding, under certain model restrictions. In this paper, we present a formal framework for causal inference based on Mendelian randomization and suggest using directed acyclic graphs to check model assumptions by visual inspection. This framework allows us to address limitations of the Mendelian randomization technique that have often been overlooked in the medical literature.},

	abstract = {Background: Mendelian randomization ({MR}) applies instrumental variable ({IV}) methods to observational data using a genetic variant as an {IV}. Several Monte‐Carlo studies investigate the performance of {MR} methods with binary outcomes, but few consider them in conjunction with binary risk factors.
Objective: To develop a novel {MR} estimator for scenarios with a binary risk factor and outcome; and compare to existing {MR} estimators via simulations and real data analysis.
Methods: A bivariate Bernoulli distribution is adapted to the {IV} setting. Empirical bias and asymptotic coverage probabilities are estimated via simulations. The proposed method is compared to the Wald method, two‐stage predictor substitution (2SPS), two‐stage residual inclusion (2SRI), and the generalized method of moments ({GMM}). An analysis is performed using existing data from the {CLEAR} study to estimate the potential causal effect of smoking on rheumatoid arthritis risk in African Americans.
Results: Bias was low for the proposed method and comparable to 2SPS. The Wald method was often biased towards the null. Coverage was adequate for the proposed method, 2SPS, and 2SRI. Coverage for the Wald and {GMM} methods was poor in several scenarios. The causal effect of ever smoking on rheumatoid arthritis risk was not statistically significant using a variety of genetic instruments.
Conclusions: Simulations suggest the proposed {MR} method is sound with binary risk factors and outcomes, and comparable to 2SPS and 2SRI in terms of bias. The proposed method also provides more natural framework for hypothesis testing compared to 2SPS or 2SRI, which require ad‐hoc variance adjustments.},

We show that for this setup, the Lasso may not consistently select the invalid instruments if these are relatively strong. We propose a median estimator that is consistent when less than 50\% of the instruments are invalid, and its consistency does not depend on the relative strength of the instruments, or their correlation structure. We show that this estimator can be used for adaptive Lasso estimation, with the resulting estimator having oracle properties.

	abstract = {This paper analyzes the conditions under which consistent estimation can be achieved in instrumental variables ({IV}) regression when the available instruments are weak and the number of instruments, Kn, goes to inﬁnity with the sample size. We show that consistent estimation depends importantly on the strength of the instruments as measured by rn, the rate of growth of the so-called concentration parameter, and also on Kn. In particular, when Kn → ∞, the concentration parameter can grow, even if each individual instrument is only weakly correlated with the endogenous explanatory variables, and consistency of certain estimators can be established under weaker conditions than have previously been assumed in the literature. Hence, the use of many weak instruments may actually improve the performance of certain point estimators. More speciﬁcally, we ﬁnd that the limited information maximum likelihood ({LIML}) estimator an√d the bias-corrected two-stage least squares (B2SLS) estimator are consistent when Kn/rn → 0 while the two-stage least squares (2SLS) estimator is consistent only if Kn/rn → 0 as n → ∞. These consistency results suggest that {LIML} and B2SLS are more robust to instrument weakness than 2SLS.},

In this Review, we discuss the evidence for pleiotropy in contemporary genetic mapping studies, new and established analytical approaches to identifying pleiotropic effects, sources of spurious cross-phenotype effects and study design considerations. We also outline the molecular and clinical implications of such findings and discuss future directions of research.},

	abstract = {Mendelian randomization ({MR}) is an increasingly important tool for appraising causality in observational epidemiology. The technique exploits the principle that genotypes are not generally susceptible to reverse causation bias and confounding, reﬂecting their ﬁxed nature and Mendel’s ﬁrst and second laws of inheritance. The approach is, however, subject to important limitations and assumptions that, if unaddressed or compounded by poor study design, can lead to erroneous conclusions. Nevertheless, the advent of 2-sample approaches (in which exposure and outcome are measured in separate samples) and the increasing availability of open-access data from large consortia of genome-wide association studies and population biobanks mean that the approach is likely to become routine practice in evidence synthesis and causal inference research. In this article we provide an overview of the design, analysis, and interpretation of {MR} studies, with a special emphasis on assumptions and limitations. We also consider different analytic strategies for strengthening causal inference. Although impossible to prove causality with any single approach, {MR} is a highly cost-effective strategy for prioritizing intervention targets for disease prevention and for strengthening the evidence base for public health policy.

The principles of {MR} are based on Mendel’s laws of inheritance and instrumental variable estimation methods, which enable the inference of causal effects in the presence of unobserved confounding. In this Primer, we outline the principles of {MR}, the instrumental variable conditions underlying {MR} estimation and some of the methods used for estimation. We go on to discuss how the assumptions underlying an {MR} study can be assessed and describe methods of estimation that are robust to certain violations of these assumptions. We give examples of a range of studies in which {MR} has been applied, the limitations of current methods of analysis and the outlook for {MR} in the future. The differences between the assumptions required for {MR} analysis and other forms of epidemiological studies means that {MR} can be used as part of a triangulation across multiple sources of evidence for causal inference.},

	shorttitle = {False discovery rates},
	abstract = {We introduce a new Empirical Bayes approach for large-scale hypothesis testing, including estimating false discovery rates ({FDRs}), and effect sizes. This approach has two key differences from existing approaches to {FDR} analysis. First, it assumes that the distribution of the actual (unobserved) effects is unimodal, with a mode at 0. This “unimodal assumption” ({UA}), although natural in many contexts, is not usually incorporated into standard {FDR} analysis, and we demonstrate how incorporating it brings many beneﬁts. Speciﬁcally, the {UA} facilitates efﬁcient and robust computation—estimating the unimodal distribution involves solving a simple convex optimization problem—and enables more accurate inferences provided that it holds. Second, the method takes as its input two numbers for each test (an effect size estimate and corresponding standard error), rather than the one number usually used (p value or z score). When available, using two numbers instead of one helps account for variation in measurement precision across tests. It also facilitates estimation of effects, and unlike standard {FDR} methods, our approach provides interval estimates (credible regions) for each effect in addition to measures of signiﬁcance. To provide a bridge between interval estimates and signiﬁcance measures, we introduce the term “local false sign rate” to refer to the probability of getting the sign of an effect wrong and argue that it is a superior measure of signiﬁcance than the local {FDR} because it is both more generally applicable and can be more robustly estimated. Our methods are implemented in an R package ashr available from http://github.com/stephens999/ashr.},

Although {WAIC} is asymptotically equal to {LOO}, we demonstrate that {PSIS}-{LOO} is more robust in the ﬁnite case with weak priors or inﬂuential observations. As a byproduct of our calculations, we also obtain approximate standard errors for estimated predictive errors and for comparison of predictive errors between two models.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Recent clinical guidelines support intensive blood pressure treatment targets. However, observational data suggest that excessive diastolic blood pressure ({DBP}) lowering might increase the risk of myocardial infarction ({MI}), reflecting a J- or U-shaped relationship.
{METHODS}: We analyzed 47 407 participants from 5 cohorts (median age, 60 years). First, to corroborate previous observational analyses, we used traditional statistical methods to test the shape of association between {DBP} and cardiovascular disease ({CVD}). Second, we created polygenic risk scores of {DBP} and systolic blood pressure and generated linear Mendelian randomization ({MR}) estimates for the effect of {DBP} on {CVD}. Third, using novel nonlinear {MR} approaches, we evaluated for nonlinearity in the genetic relationship between {DBP} and {CVD} events. Comprehensive {MR} interrogation of {DBP} required us to also model systolic blood pressure, given that the 2 are strongly correlated.
{RESULTS}: Traditional observational analysis of our cohorts suggested a J-shaped association between {DBP} and {MI}. By contrast, linear {MR} analyses demonstrated an adverse effect of increasing {DBP} increments on {CVD} outcomes, including {MI} ({MI} hazard ratio, 1.07 per unit mm Hg increase in {DBP}; P{\textless}0.001). Furthermore, nonlinear {MR} analyses found no evidence for a J-shaped relationship; instead confirming that {MI} risk decreases consistently per unit decrease in {DBP}, even among individuals with low values of baseline {DBP}.
{CONCLUSIONS}: In this analysis of the genetic effect of {DBP}, we found no evidence for a nonlinear J- or U-shaped relationship between {DBP} and adverse {CVD} outcomes; including {MI}.},

To avoid false positive due to potential pleiotropic eﬀects of the genetic markers, we performed a leave-one-out sensitivity analysis and an {MR}-Egger sensitivity analysis that we expanded in the survival context.
Results: Our results show that elevated {BMI} increases the absolute risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D) (p = 7.68e −04), heart failure (p = 9.03e −03), and cardiovascular diseases ({CVD}) (p = 1.69e− 03) and the causal eﬀects start at diﬀerent ages. A signiﬁcant association between {BMI} and the risk of stroke is observed; however, the sensitivity analyses suggest that the association is attributed to the potential pleiotropic eﬀects of rs2867125 and rs1558902. Raised {SBP} levels are signiﬁcantly associated with the development of atrial ﬁbrillation (p = 6.42e −03). Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ({LDL}-C) levels are inversely associated with the age-at-onset of T2D (p = 1.05e− 02). In addition, {LDL}-C and triglycerides are inversely associated with the risks of cancer and T2D, respectively. Nevertheless, the sensitivity analyses suggest that these associations are probably due to pleiotropic eﬀects of several single-nucleotide polymorphisms including rs4970834 and rs1260326.
Conclusions: Our results highlight the involvement of {BMI} in the development of multiple age-related diseases. Some observed causal associations can attribute to pleiotropic eﬀects of some genetic variations. These ﬁndings have important implications in unraveling causal eﬀects of common risk factors on age-related diseases and guiding eﬀective intervention strategies to reduce the incidence of these diseases.},

In addition to the classical methods of differential protein gel or blot staining by dyes and fluorophores, mass-spectrometry-based quantification methods have gained increasing popularity over the past five years. Most of these methods employ differential stable isotope labeling to create a specific mass tag that can be recognized by a mass spectrometer and at the same time provide the basis for quantification. These mass tags can be introduced into proteins or peptides (i) metabolically, (ii) by chemical means, (iii) enzymatically, or (iv) provided by spiked synthetic peptide standards. In contrast, label-free quantification approaches aim to correlate the mass spectrometric signal of intact proteolytic peptides or the number of peptide sequencing events with the relative or absolute protein quantity directly. In this review, we critically examine the more commonly used quantitative mass spectrometry methods for their individual merits and discuss challenges in arriving at meaningful interpretations of quantitative proteomic data.},

	doi = {10.1214/20-STS802},
	abstract = {Mendelian randomization ({MR}) is a popular instrumental variable ({IV}) approach, in which one or several genetic markers serve as {IVs} that can sometimes be leveraged to recover valid inferences about a given exposure-outcome causal association subject to unmeasured confounding. A key {IV} identiﬁcation condition known as the exclusion restriction states that the {IV} cannot have a direct effect on the outcome which is not mediated by the exposure in view. In {MR} studies, such an assumption requires an unrealistic level of prior knowledge about the mechanism by which genetic markers causally affect the outcome. As a result, possible violation of the exclusion restriction can seldom be ruled out in practice. To address this concern, we introduce a new class of {IV} estimators which are robust to violation of the exclusion restriction under data generating mechanisms commonly assumed in {MR} literature. The proposed approach named “{MR} G-Estimation under No Interaction with Unmeasured Selection” ({MR} {GENIUS}) improves on Robins’ G-estimation by making it robust to both additive unmeasured confounding and violation of the exclusion restriction assumption. In certain key settings, {MR} {GENIUS} reduces to the estimator of Lewbel (J. Bus. Econom. Statist. 30 (2012) 67–80) which is widely used in econometrics but appears largely unappreciated in {MR} literature. More generally, {MR} {GENIUS} generalizes Lewbel’s estimator to several key practical {MR} settings, including multiplicative causal models for binary outcome, multiplicative and odds ratio exposure models, case control study design and censored survival outcomes.},

	abstract = {Mendelian randomization ({MR}) is an application of instrumental variable ({IV}) methods to observational data in which the {IV} is a genetic variant. {MR} methods applicable to the general exponential family of distributions are currently not well characterized. We adapt a general linear model framework to the {IV} setting and propose a general {MR} method applicable to any full‐rank distribution from the exponential family. Empirical bias and coverage are estimated via simulations. The proposed method is compared to several existing {MR} methods. Real data analyses are performed using data from the {REGARDS} study to estimate the potential causal effect of smoking frequency on stroke risk in African Americans. In simulations with binary variates and very weak instruments the proposed method had the lowest median [Q1, Q3] bias (0.10 [−3.68 to 3.62]); compared with 2SPS (0.27 [−3.74 to 4.26]) and the Wald method (−0.69 [−1.72 to 0.35]). Low bias was observed throughout other simulation scenarios; as well as more than 90\% coverage for the proposed method. In simulations with count variates, the proposed method performed comparably to 2SPS; the Wald method maintained the most consistent low bias; and 2SRI was biased towards the null. Real data analyses find no evidence for a causal effect of smoking frequency on stroke risk. The proposed {MR} method has low bias and acceptable coverage across a wide range of distributional scenarios and instrument strengths; and provides a more parsimonious framework for asymptotic hypothesis testing compared to existing two‐stage procedures.},

Conventional analyses of this relationship are susceptible to omitted variable bias from variables that jointly influence both hospital admission and adipose status.

We estimate the individual and joint effects of {BMI}, {WHR}, and {WHR} adjusted for {BMI}. We also implement multivariable instrumental variable methods in which the causal effect of one exposure is estimated conditionally on the causal effect of another exposure. Data on 310,471 participants and over 550,000 inpatient admissions in the {UK} Biobank were used to perform one-sample and twosample Mendelian randomization analyses. The results supported a causal role of adiposity on hospital admis­ sions, with consistency across all estimates and sensitivity analyses. Point estimates were generally larger than estimates from comparable observational specifications. We observed an attenuation of the {BMI} effect when adjusting for {WHR} in the multivariable Mendelian randomization analyses, suggesting that an adverse fat dis­ tribution, rather than a higher {BMI} itself, may drive the relationship between adiposity and risk of hospital admission.},

However, the underlying reasons remain unclear. We conducted a Mendelian randomization analysis to investigate a possible causal role of {BMI} in survival from breast cancer.
Methods: We used individual-level data from six large breast cancer case-cohorts including a total of 36 210 individuals (2475 events) of European ancestry. We created a {BMI} genetic risk score ({GRS}) based on genotypes at 94 known {BMI}-associated genetic variants. Association between the {BMI} genetic score and breast cancer survival was analysed by Cox regression for each study separately. Study-speciﬁc hazard ratios were pooled using ﬁxed-effect meta-analysis.
Results: {BMI} genetic score was found to be associated with reduced breast cancer-speciﬁc survival for estrogen receptor ({ER})-positive cases [hazard ratio ({HR}) ¼ 1.11, per one-unit increment of {GRS}, 95\% conﬁdence interval ({CI}) 1.01–1.22, P ¼ 0.03). We observed no association for {ER}-negative cases ({HR} ¼ 1.00, per one-unit increment of {GRS}, 95\% {CI} 0.89–1.13, P ¼ 0.95).
Conclusions: Our ﬁndings suggest a causal effect of increased {BMI} on reduced breast cancer survival for {ER}-positive breast cancer. There is no evidence of a causal effect of higher {BMI} on survival for {ER}-negative breast cancer cases.},

	abstract = {Background Low birthweight has been consistently shown to be associated with coronary heart disease ({CHD}) and its biological risk factors. The effects of low birthweight are increased by slow infant growth and rapid weight gain in childhood. To quantify the importance of developmental processes in the genesis of {CHD} it is necessary to establish the impact of fetal, infant and childhood growth on major pathological events in later life—death, hospital treatment and the need for medication.
Methods Longitudinal study of 13 517 men and women who were born in Helsinki University Hospital during 1924–1944, whose body sizes at birth and during childhood were recorded, and in whom deaths, hospital admissions, and prescription of medication for chronic disease are documented.
Results The combination of small size at birth and during infancy, followed by accelerated weight gain from age 3 to 11 years, predicts large differences in the cumulative incidence of {CHD}, type 2 diabetes and hypertension.
Conclusions Coronary heart disease and type 2 diabetes may originate through two widespread biological phenomena—developmental plasticity and compensatory growth.},

We applied the summary data-based Mendelian randomization ({SMR}) method to 28 {GWAS} summary datasets to identify genes whose expression levels were associated with traits and diseases due to pleiotropy or causality (the expression level of a gene and the trait are affected by the same causal variant at a locus). We identified 71 genes, of which 17 are novel associations (no {GWAS} hit within 1 Mb distance of the genes). We integrated all the results in an online database (http://www.cnsgenomics/shiny/{SMRdb}/), providing important resources to prioritize genes for further follow-up, for example in functional studies.},

Most existing {TWAS} tools require cumbersome preparation of genotype input ﬁles and extra coding to enable parallel computation. To improve the efﬁciency of {TWAS} tools, we developed Transcriptome-Integrated Genetic Association Resource V2 ({TIGAR}-V2), which directly reads Variant Call Format ({VCF}) ﬁles, enables parallel computation, and reduces up to 90\% of computation cost (mainly due to loading genotype data) compared to the original version. {TIGAR}-V2 can train gene expression imputation models using either nonparametric Bayesian Dirichlet process regression ({DPR}) or Elastic-Net (as used by {PrediXcan}), perform {TWASs} using either individual-level or summary-level genome-wide association study ({GWAS}) data, and implement both burden and variance-component statistics for gene-based association tests. We trained gene expression prediction models by {DPR} for 49 tissues using Genotype-Tissue Expression ({GTEx}) V8 by {TIGAR}-V2 and illustrated the usefulness of these Bayesian cis-expression quantitative trait locus ({eQTL}) weights through {TWASs} of breast and ovarian cancer utilizing public {GWAS} summary statistics. We identiﬁed 88 and 37 risk genes, respectively, for breast and ovarian cancer, most of which are either known or near previously identiﬁed {GWAS} (\$95\%) or {TWAS} (\$40\%) risk genes and three novel independent {TWAS} risk genes with known functions in carcinogenesis. These ﬁndings suggest that {TWASs} can provide biological insight into the transcriptional regulation of complex diseases. The {TIGAR}-V2 tool, trained Bayesian cis-{eQTL} weights, and linkage disequilibrium ({LD}) information from {GTEx} V8 are publicly available, providing a useful resource for mapping risk genes of complex diseases.},

	abstract = {Background: Mendelian randomization ({MR}) is a powerful tool in epidemiology that can be used to estimate the causal effect of an exposure on an outcome in the presence of unobserved confounding, by utilizing genetic variants that are instrumental variables ({IVs}) for the exposure. This has been extended to multivariable {MR} ({MVMR}) to estimate the effect of two or more exposures on an outcome.
Methods and results: We use simulations and theory to clarify the interpretation of estimated effects in a {MVMR} analysis under a range of underlying scenarios, where a secondary exposure acts variously as a confounder, a mediator, a pleiotropic pathway and a collider. We then describe how instrument strength and validity can be assessed for an {MVMR} analysis in the single-sample setting, and develop tests to assess these assumptions in the popular two-sample summary data setting. We illustrate our methods using data from {UK} Biobank to estimate the effect of education and cognitive ability on body mass index.
Conclusion: {MVMR} analysis consistently estimates the direct causal effect of an exposure, or exposures, of interest and provides a powerful tool for determining causal effects in a wide range of scenarios with either individual- or summary-level data.},

              Inference of causality between gene expression and complex traits using Mendelian randomization ({MR}) is confounded by pleiotropy and linkage disequilibrium ({LD}) of gene-expression quantitative trait loci ({eQTL}). Here, we propose an {MR} method, {MR}-link, that accounts for unobserved pleiotropy and {LD} by leveraging information from individual-level data, even when only one {eQTL} variant is present. In simulations, {MR}-link shows false-positive rates close to expectation (median 0.05) and high power (up to 0.89), outperforming all other tested {MR} methods and coloc. Application of {MR}-link to low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ({LDL}-C) measurements in 12,449 individuals with expression and protein {QTL} summary statistics from blood and liver identifies 25 genes causally linked to {LDL}-C. These include the known
              {SORT}1
              and {ApoE} genes as well as
              {PVRL}2
              , located in the
              {APOE}
              locus, for which a causal role in liver was not known. Our results showcase the strength of {MR}-link for transcriptome-wide causal inferences.},
