# Introduction

Great interest has developed in inferring causal relationships between complex 
traits in observational human genetics studies. 

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) present unique opportunities for 
discovery of causal relationships via mendelian randomization.

Methods for Mendelian randomization have appeared at a rapid pace since the 
appearance of the first published GWAS. 

Now, GWAS and Mendelian randomization for Biobank-scale data offer the possibility
of discovering even more causal relationships among complex traits. The large
sample sizes offer the possibility of uncovering associations of modest strength 
that might be undetectable in smaller sample sizes. 




# Mendelian Randomization with one Instrument

Mendelian randomization with one instrument uses a single genetic marker 
as the proxy ("instrument" or "instrumental variable") for the "exposure", or 
putative cause, in a causal inference study. When the genetic marker is a single
nucleotide polymorphism on an autosome, the cohort is partitioned into three 
classes, two homozygotes and a heterozygote, based on genotypes for that marker.



## Assumptions of Mendelian Randomization
