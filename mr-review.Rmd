# Introduction

Great interest has developed in inferring causal relationships between complex 
traits, *i.e.*, traits that seemingly are not inherited in a Mendelian fashion, in observational human genetics studies. Discovery of such relationships is crucial to 
enhancing our understanding of the biology of health and disease. Two-sample 
Mendelian randomization (MR) studies are a form of instrumental variable analysis in which
genetic markers, typically single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), serve as instruments for 
inferring causal effects of an exposure variable on an outcome variable [@wright1928tariff;@wright1921correlation;@wright1923theory;@stock2003retrospectives;@katan1986apolipoprotein;@katan2004commentary;@didelez2007mendelian]. They are termed 
"two-sample" MR studies because the exposure variable and the outcome variable are measured on 
two non-overlapping cohorts of subjects. Importantly, the SNP instruments are measured in both sets of subjects.


Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) present unique opportunities for 
discovery of causal relationships via MR. A GWAS
interrogates millions of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to infer which affect the trait. A 
SNP is a genetic marker defined by nucleotide base identity at a single genomic position.

Methods for Mendelian randomization have appeared at a rapid and accelerating pace since the 
appearance of the first GWAS (Figure \@ref(fig:article-counts)). 

Recent developments have enabled execution of two-sample MR studies with only 
GWAS summary statistics [@burgess2015using]. These methods are especially pertinent now that there is an abundance of freely available GWAS summary data [@buniello2019nhgri]. GWAS summary statistics typically consist of an identifier and a p-value for every SNP in the data set, along with the sample size [@buniello2019nhgri].






Modern GWAS for biobank-scale data offer the possibility
of discovering even more causal relationships among complex traits. The large
sample sizes in biobank studies, often greater than 100,000 
subjects, offer the possibility of uncovering associations of modest strength 
that might be undetectable in smaller studies. For example, the UK 
Biobank Study involves more than 500,000 subjects. Each UKB subject's 
data consists of millions of SNP genotypes and measurements for 
thousands of traits [@bycroft_uk_2018]. 











# Mendelian Randomization with one Instrument

We begin our discussion of Mendelian randomization in GWAS data by considering the simplest case, where 
there is a single genetic marker and a single outcome variable. Mendelian randomization with one 
instrument uses a single genetic marker 
as the proxy ("instrument" or "instrumental variable") for the "exposure", a complex trait, and asks 
whether variation in the genotypes at the genetic marker causes variation in the 
"outcome" variable, which is typically a second complex trait. When the genetic marker 
is a SNP on an autosome, the cohort is partitioned into three 
classes, two homozygote classes and a single heterozygote class, based on genotypes 
for that marker. When the three assumptions of mendelian randomization are satisfied, 
estimation of the causal effect of the exposure on the outcome is possible. 

The outcome variable can be binary, a count, or a continuous variable. 

## Assumptions of Mendelian Randomization

Three assumptions are central to MR. Satisfying them is necessary to infer 
causal effects in an observational MR study. In practice, careful evaluation of the assumptions is needed. 
The first assumption states that the exposure is associated with the outcome. The second requires 
independence, conditional on the exposure and all measured and unmeasured confounders, between the 
genetic marker and the outcome. The last of the three assumptions states that the genetic marker is 
independent of all (measured and unmeasured) confounders of the relationship between exposure and 
outcome. We next discuss these in more detail and consider their evaluation in MR studies [@vanderweele_methodological_2014].

If the first assumption, about the association between the genetic marker and the exposure, holds, 
but this association is weak, then an amplification of biases, such as those due to violations of 
assumptions 2 and 3, may result [@vanderweele_methodological_2014]. 

The second assumption, often termed the exclusion restriction assumption, can also be stated as 
the need for the genetic marker to affect the outcome only through the exposure. In a 
causal diagram, this means that the only path from the marker to the outcome is that 
containing the exposure.

The third assumption ensures that the genetic marker is
independent of all confounders of the exposure-outcome relationship. 

When the three MR assumptions hold, one may use instrumental variable statistical methods, 
with the genetic marker data, the exposure data, and the outcome data, to estimate and to test the 
causal effect of the exposure on the outcome [@didelez_mendelian_2007;@lawlor_mendelian_2008;@palmer_adjusting_2008]. 

To understand the origin of the term "Mendelian randomization", it is helpful to 
recall Mendel's inheritance laws. Under the assumption that alleles segregate 
randomly from parent to offspring, the offspring genotypes are unlikely to be 
associated with confounders of the exposure-outcome relationship. Additionally,
reverse causation is ruled out by the observation that germ-line genotypes are 
fixed at conception and, thus, precede other observed variables.



## Statistical models and methods for MR with one instrument and one outcome


The approaches to MR can be classified into two categories: two-stage methods and 
likelihood-based methods. Both two-stage strategies and likelihood-based strategies 
make parametric assumptions for the identification of causal effects [@burgess_review_2017].



A two-stage statistical model involves two regression models [@burgess_review_2017]. For a continuous 
outcome, one may choose to perform "two-stage least squares", which involves two linear regressions. 
First, the exposure variable is regressed on the instrument (*i.e.*, the SNP genotypes) (Equation \@ref(eq:lm1)). The resulting 
fitted values for the exposure variable are the independent variable in the second linear regression, 
where the outcome variable is the dependent variable. The causal effect estimate, then, is the 
coefficient obtained from the second regression analysis. 


\begin{equation}
  x_i = \alpha_0 + \alpha_1 z_i + \epsilon_i
  (\#eq:lm1)
\end{equation}

where the $\epsilon_i$ are assumed to be iid normal random variables with mean zero. 





\begin{equation}
  y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \hat x_i + \tau_i
  (\#eq:lm2)
\end{equation}


where the $\tau_i$ are assumed to be iid normal random variables with mean zero and $\hat x_i$ denotes the fitted value for $x_i$ obtained from Equation \@ref(eq:lm1).




Note that the uncertainty in the fitted values from 
the first regression is not considered when performing the second regression.
For this reason, the variance of the coefficient estimator, $Var(\hat \beta_1)$ is incorrect in two-stage calculations. This observation led researchers to develop likelihood-based MR methods.












## Assumption violations

There are several ways that experimental data may violate one or more of the three MR assumptions.
Let's first consider the exclusion restriction assumption. It states that the genetic marker 
must affect the outcome only through the exposure. The causal diagram in Figure \@ref(fig:dag1) illustrates 
a scenario that violates this assumption when the variable X is used as the exposure [@vanderweele_methodological_2014]. Bias in causal effect estimation would result. However, 
if variable W is measured and treated as the exposure, then an unbiased estimate of causal effect is 
possible, since W captures the two pathways, W -> Y and W -> X -> Y, through which the genetic marker G 
affects the outcome Y [@vanderweele_methodological_2014;@textor2011dagitty;@textor2016robust].

```{r, dag1, fig.cap = "Scenario where the genetic variant G affects an intermediate variable W on the pathway to the exposure X. This violates the exclusion restriction assumption."}
g1 <- dagitty::dagitty( "dag {
	G -> W -> X -> Y
	W -> Y
}")
plot(dagitty::graphLayout(g1))
```






Recognition of the many ways that the MR assumptions may be violated has inspired methods advances that 
enable assumption relaxations under certain conditions and has motivated use of sensitivity analysis to quantify the impact of possible assumption violations. 

## Sensitivity analysis for MR with one instrument and one outcome

Sensitivity analysis is recommended and widely used in MR studies because of the inability to verify 
the three MR assumptions with observational data. The goal of a sensitivity analysis is to gain insight 
into how the results might differ were we able to verify the MR assumptions.










# Mendelian Randomization with multiple instruments

Recognition of complex traits' diverse genetic architectures has fueled development of two-sample MR methods with multiple instruments [@Boyle2017]. 




# Horizontal pleiotropy

Horizontal pleiotropy refers to the presence of multiple pathways from a genetic 
variant to the outcome. One of these multiple pathways may contain the exposure variable.
The fact that there are multiple pathways from the genetic variant to the outcome violates
the MR assumptions. @verbanck_detection_2018 documented widespread horizontal pleiotropy 
in GWAS. This finding motivated the development of MR-PRESSO and inspired 
further research into methods to accommodate horizontal pleiotropy in MR studies [@verbanck_detection_2018].
* What does MR-PRESSO do? What are its limitations?

# Recent Findings

## Omnigenic MR

Recent research on the omnigenic hypothesis, which posits 
that every SNP's effect on a trait is nonzero, has informed
MR methods development [@Boyle2017]. @wang_mendelian_nodate 
recognized the limitations of previous MR methods in the 
context of the omnigenic hypothesis. To accommodate the possibility
that a trait is influenced by many genome-wide, small effects, 

## Multiple outcomes in MR

Investigators have found that combining information from multiple related 
traits can lead to richer MR results. 

One approach to combining information across traits is to extend the 
univariate MR statistical methods to their multivariate analogs.
