# Introduction

Great interest has developed in inferring causal relationships between complex 
traits in observational human genetics studies. 

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) present unique opportunities for 
discovery of causal relationships via mendelian randomization.

Methods for Mendelian randomization have appeared at a rapid and accelerating pace since the 
appearance of the first GWAS. 

Now, GWAS and Mendelian randomization for Biobank-scale data offer the possibility
of discovering even more causal relationships among complex traits. The large
sample sizes in biobank studies offer the possibility of uncovering associations of modest strength 
that might be undetectable in smaller sample sizes. 




# Mendelian Randomization with one Instrument

Mendelian randomization with one instrument uses a single genetic marker 
as the proxy ("instrument" or "instrumental variable") for the "exposure" in a causal inference study. When the genetic marker is a single
nucleotide polymorphism on an autosome, the cohort is partitioned into three 
classes, two homozygotes and a heterozygote, based on genotypes for that marker.



## Assumptions of Mendelian Randomization

Three assumptions are central to Mendelian Randomization.

The first, often termed the

# Applications and Recent Findings

## Omnigenic MR

Recent research on the omnigenic hypothesis, which posits 
that every SNP's effect on a trait is nonzero, has informed
MR methods development [@Boyle2017]. @wang_mendelian_nodate 
recognized the limitations of previous MR methods in the 
context of the omnigenic hypothesis. To accommodate the possibility
that a trait is influenced by many genome-wide small effects,
