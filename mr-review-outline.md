# 1 Introduction

Great interest has developed in inferring causal relationships between
complex traits in observational human genetics studies.

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) present unique opportunities for
discovery of causal relationships via mendelian randomization.

Methods for Mendelian randomization have appeared at a rapid and
accelerating pace since the appearance of the first GWAS.

Now, GWAS and Mendelian randomization for biobank-scale data offer the
possibility of discovering even more causal relationships among complex
traits.

# 2 Mendelian Randomization with one Instrument

We begin our discussion of Mendelian randomization by considering the
simplest case, where there is a single genetic marker and a single
outcome variable.

A MR study can be performed with one sample or two samples.

## 2.1 Assumptions of Mendelian Randomization

Three assumptions are central to Mendelian Randomization.

## 2.2 Assumption violations

Several real world settings may give rise to violations of one or more
of the three assumptions.

## 2.3 Statistical models for MR with one instrument and one outcome

Statistical models for MR with one instrument can be formulated as two
linear regressions.

## 2.4 Statistical methods for MR with one instrument and one outcome

Estimation and testing for unknown parameters proceeds in one of several
approaches.

## 2.5 Sensitivity analysis for MR with one instrument and one outcome

Sensitivity analysis is recommended and widely used in MR studies
because of the inability to verify the three MR assumptions.

# 3 Mendelian Randomization with multiple instruments

Recognizing that many genetic markers collectively may affect a trait,
investigators adapted single-instrument MR methods to accommodate
multiple genetic markers.

# 4 Horizontal pleiotropy

Linkage disequilibrium, which refers to genotype correlations for
genetic markers that are near each other, manifests as horizontal
pleiotropy in MR studies.

# 5 Correlated horizontal pleiotropy

# 6 Recent Findings

## 6.1 Omnigenic MR

## 6.2 Multiple outcomes in MR

## 6.3 MR with summary statistics (Morrison et al.)

# 7 Applications of MR in GWAS

# 8 Summary and Outlook

1.  greater sample sizes and richer, molecular phenotyping will continue
    to enable causal inferences in observational human genetics studies

2.  ??Experimental validation in animal models?? PerturbSeq?? CRISPR
    manipulation of putative causal genes??

3.  Robustness to assumptions violations
