# 1 Introduction

# 2 Mendelian Randomization with one Instrument

## 2.1 Assumptions of Mendelian Randomization

## 2.2 Assumption violations

## 2.3 Statistical models for MR with one instrument and one outcome

## 2.4 Statistical methods for MR with one instrument and one outcome

# 3 Mendelian Randomization with multiple instruments

# 4 Horizontal pleiotropy

# 5 Correlated horizontal pleiotropy

# 6 Recent Findings

## 6.1 Omnigenic MR

## 6.2 Multiple outcomes in MR

# 7 Applications of MR in GWAS

# 8 Summary and Outlook

1.  greater sample sizes and richer, molecular phenotyping will continue
    to enable causal inferences in observational human genetics studies

2.  ??Experimental validation in animal models?? PerturbSeq?? CRISPR
    manipulation of putative causal genes??

3.  Robustness to assumptions violations
